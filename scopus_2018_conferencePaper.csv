The basic deep bed filtration model of a monodisperse suspension in a porous medium is considered. Based on the synthesis of the standard asymptotic solution for a short time and the asymptotics of the filtration problem for a long time, a uniform asymptotic solution is constructed. A numerical calculation shows that the asymptotics is close to the solution for any time. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Filtration; Asymptotic solutions; Deep bed filtration model; Filtration problems; Mono-disperse; Numerical calculation; Porous medium; Uniform asymptotic solutions; Uniform asymptotics; Porous materials",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tsuji, M., Kobayashi, S., Mikake, S., Sato, T., Matsui, H., (2017) Procedia Eng., 191, pp. 543-550; Tien, C., Ramarao, B.V., (2007) Granular Filtration of Aerosols and Hydrosols, , (Amsterdam: Elsevier); Chrysikopoulos, C.V., Syngouna, V.I., (2014) Int.

A model of two-sized deep bed filtration particles moving with different velocities in a porous medium with three-size pores is considered. The competition of pores and various size particles for deposit formation is modeled. Solutions are constructed at the porous medium inlet and on the concentrations front of the fast particles. For constant filtration coefficients, a global exact solution is obtained.

The model includes the development of motivational, activity and evaluation components. This article focuses on the design of assessment component of students' research activities. Assessment component of pedagogical system under consideration, i.e. in a technical university, includes the proposed results and the criterion indicators; mechanisms for diagnosis and improvement methods of students' research activities. As projected results there may be: a model of high school graduate, the place of research competence in it, a model of research competence, a model of the scientific information environment of high school (resource potential). Depending on this, criteria indicators can serve as an increment of competencies in the composition and performance as well as resource potential of students research work. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a mathematical model of research activities effectiveness of the technical students. This article discusses the possibility of using the conceptual and methodological apparatus of pedagogical qualimetry in studying the process of scientific training of students. In the article the possibilities of using pedagogical qualimetry terms and methodology in the study of students' research process are observed. Diagnostics technique is offered to evaluate the efficiency of technical university students' research efficiency. The result and index of students' research system development are specified. As a result of the experiment, main components of students' research competence and their weighting values are revealed. Linear mathematical model which allows diagnosing student's research efficiency is constructed. Minimum (L min = 33.75), maximum (L max = 101.25) and threshold values of diagnostic assessment and their indicators are presented. This model is a basis for the test software which can be used further in practice. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In such networks, the amount of generated data is not high, but this data should be delivered with low delay. However, random access methods commonly used in multi-hop networks usually adopt a backoff procedure aimed at collision avoidance, which significantly increases packet delivery time in case of multi-hop transmission. In this paper, to reduce delays in multi-hop networks, we propose an extension to the well-known slotted ALOHA channel access method, which allows performing the first forwarding attempt instantly, without any backoff procedure. We have developed an analytical model to find the stability region of the proposed channel access method, as well as to find its optimal parameter values. In addition, we prove the high efficiency of the proposed method with simulation. © 2018 IEEE.","Analytical modeling; Delay; MTC; Multi-hop networks; Slotted ALOHA; Stability; WSN","Analytical models; Convergence of numerical methods; Radio communication; Delay; Industrial systems; Multihop networks; Multihop transmission; Multihop wireless network; Slotted Aloha; Slotted Aloha channel; Stability regions; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 14-50-00150","The research was done at IITP RAS and supported by the Russian Science Foundation (agreement No 14-50-00150).",,,,,,,,,,"(2017) The Zettabyte Era: Trends and Analysis, , Cisco June; Fadel, E., Gungor, V.C., Nassef, L., Akkari, N., Malik, M.A., Almasri, S., Akyildiz, I.F., A survey on wireless sensor networks for smart grid (2015) Computer Communications, 71, pp. 22-33; Sanaullah Chowdhury, M., Ullah, N., Ameen, M.A., Kwak, K.S., Framed slotted aloha based mac protocol for low energy critical infrastructure monitoring networks (2014) International Journal of Communication Systems, 27 (10), pp. 1783-1797; Buratti, C., Verdone, R., L-csma: A mac protocol for multihop linear wireless (sensor) networks (2016) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 65 (1), pp. 251-265; Burrell, A., Papantoni-Kazakos, P., Random access algorithms in packet networks-a review of three research decades (2012) International Journal of Communications, Network and System Sciences, 5 (10), p. 691; Wu, H., Zhu, C., La, R.J., Liu, X., Zhang, Y., Fast adaptive s-aloha scheme for event-driven machine-to-machine communications (2012) Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall), 2012 IEEE, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Yu, H., Yao, N., Cai, S., Han, Q., Analyzing the performance of aloha in string multi-hop underwater acoustic sensor networks (2013) EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2013 (1), p. 65; Gao, J., Yin, C., Analysis of the local delay with slottedaloha based cognitive radio Ad Hoc networks (2015) EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2015 (1), p. 27; Di Francesco, M., Anastasi, G., Conti, M., Das, S.K., Neri, V., Reliability and energy-efficiency in ieee 802. 15. 4/zigbee sensor networks: An adaptive and cross-layer approach (2011) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 29 (8), pp. 1508-1524; Loginov, V., Khorov, E., Lyakhov, A., On throughput estimation with txop sharing in ieee 802. 11 ah networks (2016) Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom), 2016 IEEE International, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Khorov, E., Lyakhov, A., Krotov, A., Guschin, A., A survey on ieee 802. 11 ah: An enabling networking technology for smart cities (2015) Computer Communications, 58, pp. 53-69; Song, Q., Lagrange, X., Nuaymi, L., An analytical model for s-aloha performance evaluation in m2m networks (2017) Communications (ICC), 2017 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 1-7. , IEEE; Silvester, J., Kleinrock, L., On the capacity of multihop slotted aloha networks with regular structure (1983) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 31 (8), pp. 974-982; Coupechoux, M., Lestable, T., Bonnet, C., Kumar, V., Throughput of the multi-hop slotted aloha with multi-packet reception (2004) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 301-314; Tsybakov, B.S., Bakirov, V., Packet transmission in radio networks (1985) Problemy Peredachi Informatsii, 21 (1), pp. 80-101; Hong, K., Hua, Y., Throughput analysis of large wireless networks with regular topologies (2007) EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, (1), p. 3; Mergen, G., Tong, L., Stability and capacity of regular wireless networks (2005) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 51 (6), pp. 1938-1953; Mangharam, R., Rajkumar, R., Max: A maximal transmission concurrency mac for wireless networks with regular structure (2006) Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems, 2006. 3rd International Conference on, pp. 1-10. , IEEE; Carleial, A., Hellman, M., Bistable behavior of aloha-type systems (1975) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 23 (4), pp. 401-410; Horiuchi, T., Sakakibara, K., Taketsugu, J., On stability of slotted-aloha systems with delay constraints and geometric transmission probability (2017) Information Networking (ICOIN), 2017 International Conference on, pp. 309-314. , IEEE; Panichpapiboon, S., Ferrari, G., Tonguz, O.K., Sensor networks with random versus uniform topology: Mac and interference considerations (2004) Vehicular Technology Conference. 2004 IEEE 59th, 4, pp. 2111-2115. , IEEE",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","29th IEEE Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, PIMRC 2018","9 September 2018 through 12 September 2018",,143803,,9781538660096,,,"English","IEEE Int Symp Person Indoor Mobile Radio Commun PIMRC",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060532367

A flow of water is supplied at the inlet of the porous medium filled with suspension. The suspension is displaced by water moving at a constant velocity. A mathematical model of deep bed filtration of suspension in a porous medium based on size-exclusion mechanism of particle retention and pore clogging is formulated. It is proved that in the suspension area the solution depends only on time, and in the clean water area - only on the distance to the porous medium inlet. For constant initial conditions an exact solution of the problem is constructed. In the case of linear filtration coefficient, the analytic solution is given in explicit form.

The method uses the construction of matrix components phase portraits. Usually the main source of information for identifying individual signs of operating radio facilities should be considered samples from the analyzed signals. Samples of sufficiently large length, obtained with a small time interval of sampling, are one of the most informative objects with respect to the properties of the signals under research. Thus, the equipment required for obtaining time series can be either specialized means, or digital oscilloscopes with the necessary operating frequency range can be used for this purpose. Identification of radiating radio facilities is possible. It is possible on the basis of a set of fixed radio emission parameters, individual values of which are inherent to each radio-emitting device, and can act as ""features"" of its individual portrait. Different individual features of the transmitting equipment should be considered. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Matrix components; Phase portraits; Radio emission; Radio transmitting devices; Signal processing; Singular decomposition; SVD","Cathode ray oscilloscopes; Radio transmitters; Signal processing; Digital oscilloscope; Individual features; Matrix components; Operating frequency; Phase portrait; Radio emission; Singular decomposition; Transmitting equipments; Singular value decomposition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gantmakher, F.R., Theory of matrices (1988) Science, p. 548p; Lancaster, P., The theory of matrices (1982) Science, p. 387p; Voevodin, V.V., Kuznetsov, Yu.A., Matrices and calculations M.: Science (1984) The Main Edition of Physics and Mathematics, p. 320; Nikulchev, E.V., (2010) Identification of Dynamical Systems Based on The Symmetries of Reconstructed Attractors, p. 100. , E.

Element concentration in NWs is differ from concentration of electrolyte and change slightly along the NW length (for alloys). For layer NWs the layers thickness and composition was determined. Different phases in alloys were found. Magnetometry measurements confirmed the magneto-hard properties of FeCo NWs and soft magnetic properties of FeNi NWs.

The approaches are numerous. RC can be applied to different architectures including recurrent neural networks with irregular connections that are called Echo State Networks (ESN). However, the existence of successful examples of chaotic sequences predictions does not provide successful method of multiple attribute objects classification. In this paper ESN binary classifiers are researched. We show that the reason of low precision of classification is using of unbalanced training dataset. Then the method to solve the problem is proposed. We propose to use stochastic perforation balancing algorithm on training data set and method of data temporalization. The resulting errors matrixes are pretty good. The proposed method is illustrated by the usage on synthetic data set.

It is used for increase of metrological accuracy of the distributed temperature sensor. All known works used averaging of the pulse response or its processing on certain algorithms for reduction of an error of transformation. It is bad idealization of used pulse signals for simplification of calculations. Thus it is supposed by default that risetime and decrease of pulse top do not influence to accuracy. The given approach does not consider an error due the transitive characteristic for any signal transferred through system with finite number of elements. It is shown that in actual life it mismatches the validity. A new distributed temperature sensor structure with the characteristics nearly to so-called potentially achievable is proposed. It is offered to use the mathematical theory of potentially achievable pulse characteristics for definition of limitations of accuracy of the pulse converter. Thus our approach is a refusal of signal idealization otherwise use the constructive methods of approximation. The new approach allows to consider transient parameters: the risetime duration, cut-off, deadtime, and peak overshoot. In turn, it minimized an error related with methods of temperature calculation. For modeling the reflected signal is presented in the form of Lanne polynomials. The second polynomial Remez algorithm has been used for finding of peak overshoot. Finally, in the paper the operation principle of distributed temperature sensor is resulted. The methods related decreasing of noise influence to measurement are designated. Some practical advice on increase accuracy of measurement by distributed temperature sensor is given. © 2018 IEEE.","accuracy of measurement; distributed temperature sensor; metrological accuracy; optical distributed temperature sensor; optical fiber; transient characteristic","Automation; Errors; Optical fibers; Accuracy of measurements; Constructive methods; Distributed temperature sensor; metrological accuracy; Pulse characteristics; Temperature calculation; Theory of automatic control; Transient characteristic; Temperature sensors",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ: 18-37-00018","Authors thank Russian Foundation for Basic Researches for financing of the project 18-37-00018 and National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University.",,,,,,,,,,"Goncharenko, A.M., Vasilev, V.A., Zhmud, V.A., Method of sensitivity rise of laser vibrometers (2003) Avtometriya, 39 (2), pp. 43-47; Marinushkin, P.S., Bakhtina, V.A., Podshivalov, I.A., Design issues for mems-based pedestrian inertial navigation systems (2015) Science & Education, pp. 157-173. , Bauman Moscow State Technical University 06 June; Allwood, G., Wild, G., Hinckley, S., Optical fiber sensors in physical intrusion detection systems: A review (2016) IEEE Sensors Journal., 16 (14), pp. 5497-5509. , July; Stukach, O.V., Sychev, I.V., Signal processing in the distributed temperature sensors by raman backscatter: Review of new outcomes (2018) Radioengineering, (3), pp. 86-92. , http://www.radiotec.ru/number/1764, (in Russian); Barmasov, S.V., Zhmud, V.A., A phase-locked loop system for the difference frequency of two lasers (2000) Instruments and Experimental Techniques., 43 (3), pp. 381-383. , May/June; Ukil, A., Braendle, H., Krippner, P., Distributed temperature sensing: Review of technology and applications (2012) IEEE Sensors Journal., 12 (5), pp. 885-892. , May; Sun, B.N., Chang, J., Lian, J., Wang, Z.L., Lv, G.P., Liu, X.Z., Wang, W.J., Zhang, S.S., Accuracy improvement of raman distributed temperature sensors based on eliminating rayleigh noise impact (2013) Optics Communications., 306, pp. 117-120. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.optcom.2013.05.049; Kuznetsova Yu, E., Fiber-optic sensor for temperature measurement (2014) Youth and Modern Information Technologies: Proceedings of the XII Conf.

The facial images are described with the off-the shelf high-dimensional features extracted with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), which was preliminarily trained with an external very-large dataset. We focus on drawbacks of conventional probabilistic neural network (PNN), namely, low recognition performance and high memory space complexity. We propose to modify the PNN by replacing the exponential activation function in the Gaussian Parzen kernel to the trigonometric functions and use the orthogonal series density estimation of the CNN features. We demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly decreases the runtime complexity of face recognition if the classes are rather balanced and there are more than five training images per each subject. An experimental study with either traditional VGGNet and Light CNN, or contemporary VGGFace2-ft and MobileNet trained on VGGFace-2 dataset, have shown that our algorithm is very efficient and rather accurate in comparison with the instance-based learning classifiers. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Complex networks; Deep neural networks; Fourier analysis; Neural networks; Orthogonal functions; Probability density function; Activation functions; Deep convolutional neural networks; High dimensional feature; Instance based learning; Probabilistic neural networks; Run time complexity; Trigonometric functions; Trigonometric series; Face recognition",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 14-41-00039; Samsung","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is based on the work supported by Samsung Research, Samsung Electronics.

The paper describes a short-term undergraduate course on microwave communication in the new propagation channel at S. Seifullin Kazakh Agro Technical University (KATU), Kazakhstan. Along with the continuously evolving curriculum of microwave engineering education, there remains a constant issue - the recognized of obligatory laboratory experience. Characterization of telemetry channel was offered to undergraduate students in the framework of research course on communications. It helps students to familiarize with specific application of microwaves in X-band. The main attention is focused on microwave measurements and its limitations, like in industry, different effects at high frequencies (higher order modes, radiation, coupling etc.), influence of scattering etc. Investigations in the new channel of geophysical information transfer became the educational project arise from opportunity given to undergraduates to receive some practice in the microwaves in very short time. It is one more unique opportunity enough to inflame interest of undergraduate students in their possible future career in urgent growing area between geophysics and microwave communications. © 2018 European Microwave Association.","Engineering facilities; logging-while-drilling systems; microwave geophysics; microwave measurement; propagation; telemetry communication channel; undergraduate course","Communication channels (information theory); Engineering facilities; Geophysics; Microwave measurement; Microwaves; Radiation effects; Telemetering equipment; Wave propagation; Geophysical information; Laboratory experiences; Logging while drilling; Microwave communications; Microwave engineering; Technical universities; Undergraduate Courses; Undergraduate students; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kochumeev, V.A., Mirmanov, A.B., Pushkarev, V.P., Stukach, O.V., Problems in design of the new microwave geophysical measuring system (2012) MIKON-International Conference on Microwave Radar and Wireless Communications, 2, pp. 516-518. , May; Stukach, O., Towards development of IEEE comsoc activities in Kazakhstan (2017) IEEE Communications Magazine., 55 (11), pp. 7-10. , November; Mirmanov, A.B., Stukach, O.V., The system problems in the microwave measurement-while-drilling telemetry for controlled drilling and modeling in matlab simulink (2014) MEACS-International Conference on Mechanical Engineering, Automation and Control Systems, , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6986885/, October, Tomsk, Russia; Goponenko, A.S., Stukach, O.V., Kochumeev, V.A., Mirmanov, A.B., Experimental investigations of microwave signal attenuation in radio link within geophysical information transmission (2014) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering., 66, p. 012008. , 4 p; Mirmanov, A.B., Stukach, O.V., The receiver-transmitter for the measurement information transfer by the inhomogeneous media (2012) IFOST-The 7th International Forum on Strategic Technology, 1, pp. 552-554. , September 17-21; Stukach, O.V., Mirmanov, A.B., 9 GHz power amplifier-transmitter on gunn diode for measurement-while-drilling system (2014) 2014 Dynamics of Systems, Mechanisms and Machines 2014, , Omsk; 11-13 November; Stukach, O.V., Mirmanov, A.B., Goponenko, A.S., Microwave equipment for MWD front-end radiolink in the Borehole pipes (2014) 2014 12th International Conference on Actual Problems of Electronic Instrument Engineering (APEIE).

For a computer-aided design it is very important to develop the collection of tests for digital LSI circuits for proving the successfulness of design. The most productive and economical test set could be generated if a formal description of digital block or system possible input data domain is known. The input data domain structure are analyzed and described for digital blocks and systems with finite alphabet of functions. The formal description of input data domain for each function of digital block or system are proposed.

The country, radically transformed in a little more than a decade the way in which it supplies energy to its internal market and its positioning in the region. The incorporation of wind energy and photovoltaic solar energy are systematically associated with this transformation, while the role that the electricity generation from biomass has played during this period is almost unknown. Perhaps the most relevant result in relation to biomass can be summarized with the following data: for the first time in recent history, in 2016, the share of -domestic and renewable - biomass exceeded the share of imported fossil resources in the primary energy supply mix. This paper analyzes the main milestones the use of biomass has had in Uruguay, with special focus on electricity generation from this resource and the main challenges this activity currently faces and the ones expected to have in the future. © 2018 IEEE.","bioeconomy; bioelectricity; biomass; valorization; waste","Bioelectric phenomena; Electric power generation; Electrophysiology; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wastes; Wind power; bioeconomy; Electricity generation; Energy transformation; Fossil resources; Photovoltaic solar energy; Primary energies; Uruguay; valorization; Biomass",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2018) Balance Energetico National 2017, , www.miem.gub.uy/energia, Direction National de Energia, Ministerio de Industria, Energia y Mineria; (2018) Estadisticas e Indicadores, , Banco Central del Uruguay; (2017) Oportunidades de Inversion-SectorForestal, , Instituto de Promotion de Inversiones y Exportaciones de Bienes y Servicios-Uruguay XXI; (2008) PoliticaEnergetica, , www.eficienciaenergetica.gub.uy/politica-energetica, Direction Nacional de Energia, Ministerio de Industria, Energia y Mineria; (2017) Politica National de Cambio Climatico, , www.uy.undp.org/content/dam/uruguay/docs/MAyE/Pol%C3%ADtica_Nacional_de_Cambio_Clim%C3%A1tico_uv.pdf, Direction de Cambio Climatico, Ministerio de Vivienda, Ordenamiento Territorial y Medio Ambiente; www.miem.gub.uy/energia/decretos-vinculados-la-bioenergia, Decreto 77/006; www.miem.gub.uy/energia/decretos-vinculados-la-bioenergia, Decreto 397/007; www.upm.uy/planta/, UPM (ex Botnia); www.miem.gub.uy/energia/decretos-vinculados-la-bioenergia, Decreto 367/010; (2014) Production de Electricidad a Partir de Biomasa"", Proyecto Probio, , www.probio.dne.gub.uy, Ministerio de Industria, Energia y Mineria; www.montesdelplata.com.uy/celulosa-y-energia-4, Montes del Plata; www.miem.gub.uy/energia/decretos-vinculados-la-bioenergia, Decreto 58/015; www.miem.gub.uy/energia/decretos-vinculados-la-bioenergia, Decreto117/017; https://medios.presidencia.gub.uy/tav_portal/2017/noticias/NO_Y823/contrato_final.pdf; Proyecto Biovalor, , www.biovalor.gub.uy, Ministerio de Industria, Energia y Mineria; Decreto de Microgeneracion, , www.miem.gub.uy/energia/decretos-vinculados-la-microgeneracion,www.miem.gub.uy/energia/resoluciones-vinculadas-la-microgeneracion; (2015) Andlisis de Componente National e Impacto Economico y Social Que Surge de la Generation de Energia Electrica a Partir de Las Siguientes Fuentes: Solar Fotovoltaica, Biomasa, Eolica y Gas Natural en Centrales de Ciclo Combinado, , Ministerio de Industria, Energia y Mineria, elaborado por SEG Ingenieria y KPMG; Irena, A., (2016) Renewable Energy and Jobs.

It was devoted to both the theoretical and practical aspects of basic income implementation. The conference was organized by the Institute for Social Policy NRU HSE, the European Dialogue Expert Group, and the German Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Russia. According to the opinion of Evgeny S. Gont-makher, professor of NRU HSE, until now, there were no such large-scale discussions on this topic. The conference was attended by a wide range of participants from the academic and political sphere as well as by public representatives. Basic income is treated not only as a new measure of social support but as a part of new social policy emerging in the context of income disparities; job automation that changes the conditions and the structure of employment; and population aging. Interconnections of basic income with inequality and pension-system adaptation were discussed as well attempts and examples of foreign projects in the field in Switzerland and Finland. The presentations provided the ability to dispel the myths about basic income, evaluate the effects of its implementation, look at it as a tool for solving different social problems, and formulate the questions that should be asked while constructing such measures of social support. The potential of basic income as a system for the Russian population was also discussed. Most conference participants agreed that it is not an issue for the near future, and a lot of questions need to be analyzed first. © 2018 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to elaborate the mechanisms of target network creation behind hubs' involvement in the network expansion.

In case the signal under investigation is a rare process, the signal sample is simulated and background sample is taken from the real data. Such setting create an unnecessary bias: the classifier might learn not the characteristic of the signal but the characteristic of the imperfect simulation. So the challenge is to train the classifier in such way that it picks up signal/background difference and doesnt overfit to the simulation-specific features. The suggested approach is based on cross-domain adaptation technique using neural networks with gradient reversal. The network architecture is a dense multi-branch structure. One branch is responsible for the signal/background discrimination, the second branch helps to avoid the overfitting on the Monte-Carlo training dataset. The tests showed that this architecture is a robust mechanism for choosing trade-offs between discrimination power and overfitting. So the resulting networks successfully distinguishes the signal from the background, but does not distinguish simulated events from the real ones. Moreover, such architecture could to be easily extended with more branches, and each one could be responsible for specific discrete and continuous domains. For example, the additional third network's branch could help to reduce the correlation between the classifier predictions and reconstructed mass of the decay, thereby making such approach highly viable for wide variety of physics searches. But such network's extensions weren't investigated during this work. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data handling; Economic and social effects; High energy physics; Information analysis; Background separation; Continuous domain; Domain adaptation; Multi-branch structures; Reconstructed mass; Robust mechanisms; Simulated events; Training dataset; Network architecture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2016), https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/, Python project, ""Python"" [software], version 2.7.13 [accessed 2017-07-12]; (2017), https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne, Lasagne project, ""Lasagne"" [software], version 0.2.dev1 [accessed 2017-07-12]; Amidi, E., (1996) A Search for the Top Quark Using Artificial Neural Networks, , (Massachusetts: Northeastem University Boston); Ganin, Y., Lempitsky, V., (2015) Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation, , (Moscow: Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology); Gaitan, V., (2016) Heavy Flavour Data Mining Workshop, , (Irchel Campus, Zurich: University of Zurich) Data Doping solution for quot;Flavours in Physicsquot; challenge; Flavours of Physics Competition, , https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics; Rogozhnikov, A., Bukva, A., Gligorov, V., Ustyuzhanin, A., Williams, M., (2015) New Approaches for Boosting to Uniformity, , (Moscow: Yandex); Ryzhikov, A., Ustyuzhanin, A., (2017) Source Code for Domain Adaptation Research, , https://github.com/Leensman/Cross-domain-adaptation-on-HEP-HSE-course-work; Goodfellow, J.I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., (2014) Generative Adversarial Networks, , (Montreal: Universite de Montreal); Kolmogorov, A., (1933) Sulla Determinazione Empirica di Una Legge di Distribuzione; Smirnov, N., (1948) Table for Estimating the Goodness of Fit of Empirical Distributions",,,,"IOP Publishing Ltd","18th International Workshop on Advanced Computing and Analysis Techniques in Physics Research, ACAT 2017","21 August 2017 through 25 August 2017",,141166,17426588,,,,"English",,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055848488

Typically, data comes from different sub-detectors and the global quality of data depends on the combinatorial performance of each of them. In this paper, the problem of identifying channels in which anomalies occurred is considered. We introduce a generic deep learning model and prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the model learns to identify 'channels' which are affected by an anomaly. Such model could be used for data quality manager cross-check and assistance and identifying good channels in anomalous data samples. The main novelty of the method is that the model does not require ground truth labels for each channel, only global flag is used. This effectively distinguishes the model from classical classification methods. Being applied to CMS data collected in the year 2010, this approach proves its ability to decompose anomaly by separate channels. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Monitoring; Classification methods; Cross check; Data anomalies; Data quality; Global quality; Ground truth; Large scale experiments; Learning models; Deep learning",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 17-72-20127","The research leading to these results was partly supported by Russian Science Foundation under grant agreement No 17-72-20127.",,,,,,,,,,"Borisyak, M., Ratnikov, F., Derkach, D., Ustyuzhanin, A., Towards Automation of Data Quality System for CERN CMS Experiment, , [physics.data-an] September 2017; Calderon, A., Open access to high-level data and analysis tools in the CMS experiment at the LHC (2015) J.

For example, SHiP experiment is going to use emulsion film detectors similar to the ones designed for OPERA experiment from dark matter search. The goal of this research is to develop an algorithm that can identify traces of electromagnetic showers in particle detectors, so it would be possible to analyse and compare various dark matter hypothesis. Both real data and signal simulation samples for this research come from OPERA experiment. Also we have used exploited algorithm for electromagnetic showers identification as a baseline.

Solutions are usually driven by a priori knowledge about expected properties of reconstructed objects. Such an approach is also used to distinguish single photons in the electromagnetic calorimeter of the LHCb detector at the LHC from overlapping photons produced from decays of high momentum π 0. We studied an alternative solution based on first principles. This approach applies neural networks and classifier based on gradient boosting method to primary calorimeter information, that is energies collected in individual cells of the energy cluster. Mutial application of this methods allows to improve separation performance based on Monte Carlo data analysis. Receiver operating characteristic score of classifier increases from 0.81 to 0.95, that means reducing primary photons fake rate by factor of two or more. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Calorimeters; Classification (of information); Data handling; Machine learning; Photons; Alternative solutions; Electromagnetic calorimeter; Gradient boosting; High energy physics experiments; Machine learning approaches; Receiver operating characteristics; Reconstructed objects; Separation performance; Monte Carlo methods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alves, A.A., Jr., The LHCb detector at the LHC (2008) JINST, 3 (8). , LHCb collaboration; Aaij, R., LHCb detector performance (2015) Int.

In LHCb, several different sub-detectors provide PID information: two Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors, the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, and the muon chambers. To improve charged particle identification, we have developed models based on deep learning and gradient boosting. The new approaches, tested on simulated samples, provide higher identification performances than the current solution for all charged particle types. It is also desirable to achieve a flat dependency of efficiencies from spectator variables such as particle momentum, in order to reduce systematic uncertainties in the physics results. For this purpose, models that improve the flatness property for efficiencies have also been developed. This paper presents this new approach and its performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Charged particles; Data handling; Deep learning; Efficiency; Information analysis; Charged particle identification; Electromagnetic calorimeter; Gradient boosting; LHC experiments; Particle identifications; Particle momentum; Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector; Systematic uncertainties; Learning systems",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: n◦ 17-72-20127","The research leading to these results has received funding from Russian Science Foundation under grant agreement n◦ 17-72-20127.",,,,,,,,,,"Ignacio, B., (2013), LHCb-TDR-014; Patrignani, C., (2016) Chin.

Typically, these models are computationally expensive, where improving of the quality the prediction leads to a decrease in the inference speed. However it is not always tradeoff between quality and speed. In this paper we show it is possible to speed up the model by using additional memory without losing significat prediction quality for a novel boosted trees algorithm called CatBoost. The idea is to combine two approaches: training fewer trees and merging trees into a kind of hashmaps called DecisionTensors. The proposed method allows for pareto-optimal reduction of the computational complexity of the decision tree model with regard to the quality of the model. In the considered example the number of lookups was decreased from 5000 to only 6 (speedup factor of 1000) while AUC score of the model was reduced by less than 10-3. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Pareto principle; Trees (mathematics); Decision tree modeling; Pareto-optimal; Prediction model; Prediction performance; Prediction quality; Speed up; Speed-up factors; Trees algorithm; Predictive analytics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gulin, A., Kuralenok, I., Pavlov, D., Winning the Transfer Learning Track of Yahoo!'s Learning to Rank Challenge with YetiRank (2011) Yahoo!

Following this discussion, GeantV has engaged onto an ambitious 2-year road-path aiming to deliver a beta version that has most of the final design and several performance features of the final product, partially integrated with some of the experiment's frameworks. The initial GeantV prototype has been updated to a vector-aware concurrent framework, which is able to deliver high-density floating-point computations for most of the performance-critical components such as propagation in field and physics models. Electromagnetic physics models were adapted for the specific GeantV requirements, aiming for the full demonstration of shower physics performance in the alpha release at the end of 2017. We have revisited and formalized GeantV user interfaces and helper protocols, allowing to: connect to user code, provide recipes to access efficiently MC truth and generate user data in a concurrent environment. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

An increase of the population of fast growing companies, the growth rate of which can be intensified through interaction between business and the state is one of the effective mechanisms for overcoming resource dependences. The article discusses the mechanism of interaction of the business community with scientific organizations using budgetary funds, which has positively established itself in foreign markets, in Russia. The authors also examined the regional aspect of state support for such cooperation. However, according to the conducted research, this mechanism does not bring positive results because of some administrative barriers, such as extremely high level of accountability, low-effective control system and transfer of foreign technologies. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Budget control; Commerce; Population statistics; Business community; Effective mechanisms; External factors; Financial system; Foreign markets; Foreign technology; National economy; Resource dependences; Investments",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR","It should be noted that the database did not include projects supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) in connection with the restricted access to the library's materials.

In a DB protocol, the verifier computes an upper bound on the distance to the prover by measuring the time-of-flight of exchanged messages. DB protocols are, however, vulnerable to distance fraud, in which a dishonest prover is able to manipulate the distance bound computed by an honest verifier. Despite their conceptual simplicity, devising a formal characterization of DB protocols and distance fraud attacks that is amenable to automated formal analysis is non-trivial, primarily because of their real-time and probabilistic nature. In this work, we introduce a generic, computational model, based on Rewriting Logic, for formally analyzing various forms of distance fraud, including recently identified timing attacks, on the Hancke-Kuhn family of DB protocols through statistical model checking. While providing an insightful formal characterization on its own, the model enables a practical formal analysis method that can help system designers bridge the gap between conceptual descriptions and low-level designs. In addition to accurately confirming known results, we use the model to define new attack strategies and quantitatively evaluate their effectiveness under realistic assumptions that would otherwise be difficult to reason about manually. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Distance fraud; Distance-bounding protocols; Maude; Probabilistic rewriting; Statistical model checking","Access control; Computer privacy; Crime; Embedded systems; Flight control systems; Distance bounding protocols; Distance frauds; Maude; Probabilistic rewriting; Statistical model checking; Model checking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agha, G., (1986) Actors: A Model of Concurrent Computation in Distributed Systems, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, USA; Agha, G., Gunter, C.A., Greenwald, M., Khanna, S., Meseguer, J., Sen, K., Thati, P., Formal Modeling and Analysis of DoS Using Probabilistic Rewrite Theories (2005) International Workshop on Foundations of Computer Security (FCS’05), , IEEE, Chicago, IL; Agha, G., Meseguer, J., Sen, K., PMaude: Rewrite-based Specification Language for Probabilistic Object Systems (2006) Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, 153 (2), pp. 213-239. , 2006; Alturki, M.A., Meseguer, J., PVeStA: A Parallel Statistical Model Checking and Quantitative Analysis Tool (2011) Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6859, pp. 386-392. , Springer Berlin / Heidelberg; Alturki, M.A., Meseguer, J., Gunter, C.A., Probabilistic Modeling and Analysis of DoS Protection for the ASV Protocol (2009) Electron.

We assume that a combination of Social Network Analysis and Machine Learning can help to achieve deeper understanding and to find patterns which are hidden from the one-side analysis. For the research, we gathered information about transfers of Dota 2 teams made between The Internationals of 2016 and 2017 and built a network based on this data. For the ERGM, we checked the importance of belonging to one region and organization, difference of skills, and participation in TI, and for association rules, on a par with the regions, we added players roles, and a metric of their personal performance – fantasy points. Summing up the results, we found out the importance of homophily within regions, detected presence of vertical mobility, and discover the influence of the specific players roles. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Dota 2; Esports; Mixed methods; Transfers","Computer applications; Computer programming; Dota 2; E-sports; Homophily; Mixed method; Network-based; Personal performance; Transfers; Learning systems",,,,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics, HSE: 17-05-0024, 2017-2018","The poster was prepared within the framework of the Academic Fund Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) in 2017-2018 (grant No. 17-05-0024) and by the Russian Academic Excellence Project 5-100.

However, this debate is often limited to the single-country perspective, disregarding decreasing global income inequalities, i.e. inequalities between individuals in the entire world. This paper focuses mainly on the g lobal dimension of the inequality trends but also tries to update statistics on national inequality trends which, contrary to the dominant narrative, seem to go in various directions depending on a concrete country. Finally, an attempt is made to analyze the potential interrelation and trade-off between decreasing global inequalities and increasing national inequalities and the role of globalization, in its various forms, in such a trade-off. © 2018 Non-profit partnership ""Voprosy Ekonomiki"".","Globalization; Income convergence; Income inequality; Wealth inequality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alesina, A., Perotti, R., Income distribution, political instability and investment (1996) European Economic Review, 40 (6), pp. 1203-1228. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2921(95)00030-5; Alvaredo, F., Atkinson, A.

The platform allows analyzing information extracted from Internet sources and structuring data for process mining execution according to event log format. The basic component of the monitoring system is the multifaceted ontology joined a few ontology types. The problem ontology describes domains representing research interests of experts needing analysis of world events to model global processes including events of specified types. Our goal for this part of KB is to provide users ability to independently expand the under study field without having any subject limitations, which makes it possible to talk about obtaining global processes models in result. The log ontology describes event logs formats. It is a 'meta-ontology' for structuring data extracted from Internet. The sources ontology defines information sources used by experts for analysis. Ontologies are used to search information on events with information retrieval tools. Ontology-driven architecture is described. The algorithm for optimizing task of searching and structuring the information on events is presented. Some examples of event mining with different tools are considered in the paper. © 2018 IEEE.","event logs; event mining; fact extraction; Internet news; multifaceted ontology; process modelling; service-oriented architecture","Information services; Ontology; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Event logs; Event mining; Fact extraction; Information sources; Monitoring system; Process modelling; Research interests; Search information; Data mining",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Khan, I., Naqvi, S.K., Alam, M., Rizvi, S.N., A framework for twitter data analysis"" (2018) Big Data Analytics, pp. 297-303. , Springer, Singapore; Lang, M., Ruscheinsky, J., Schäfers, W., Creating a real estate sentiment index through textual analysis of internet data"" (2016) European Real Estate Society (ERES; Laninga-Wijnen, L., Ryan, A.M., Harakeh, Z., Shin, H., Vollebergh, W.A., The moderating role of popular peers' achievement goals in 5th-And 6th-graders' achievement-related friendships: A social network analysis"" (2018) Journal of Educational Psychology, 110 (2); Semenov, A., Natekin, A., Nikolenko, S., Upravitelev, P., Trofimov, M., Kharchenko, M., Discerning depression propensity among participants of suicide and depression-related groups of vk.com"" (2015) Proceedings of International Conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts, pp. 24-35. , Springer, Cham; Ruscheinsky, J., Lang, M., Schaefers, W., Textual analysis based real-estate-sentiment evaluation of internet data (2017) European Real Estate Society (ERES; Lenaerts, K., Beblavý, M., Fabo, B., Prospects for utilisation of non-vacancy internet data in labour market analysis-an overview (2016) IZA Journal of Labor Economics, 5 (1); Cleaton, J.M., Viboud, C., Simonsen, L., Hurtado, A.M., Chowell, G., Characterizing ebola transmission patterns based on internet news reports Clinical Infectious Diseases, 62 (1), pp. 24-31; Shalyaeva, I.M., Lanin, V.V., Lyadova, L.N., On the project to develop a monitoring system for global processes based on internet-news Information Systems Development Technologies-TRIS-2016: Materials of the VII International Scientific and Technical Conference, 1, pp. 166-170; Shalyaeva, I., Lyadova, L., Lanin, V., Events analysis based on internet information retrieval and process mining tools (2016) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT, pp. 168-172. , 12-14 Oct. 2016, Baku: IEEE; Shalyaeva, I., Lyadova, L., Lanin, V., Ontology-driven system for monitoring global processes on basis of internet news (2017) Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT, pp. 385-389. , 20-22 Sept. 2017, Moscow: IEEE; Pradhan, N., Pandey, K., Internet search engine: Performance evaluating the google, yahoo and bing web search engine based on their searching capabilities (2018) NCDAMLS, pp. 65-70; Nasution, M.K., Semantic interpretation of search engine resultant (2018) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 300 (1), p. 012053; Markov, K., Ivanova, K., Vanhoof, K., Velychko, V., Castellanos, J., (2015) Natural Language Addressing, ITHEA Sofia, , Hasselt Kyiv Madrid",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","12th IEEE International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies, AICT 2018","17 October 2018 through 19 October 2018",,149092,,9781538664674,,,"English","IEEE Int.

AI-Based software defect predictor can predict 75% defect in software and help developer team to detect and to fix defect module before performing unit testing/system testing by quality assurance. Some research tried to construct prediction model using other project datasets, which is called cross-project defect prediction. Nevertheless, the project should have the same software metric attribute. Recently, web application takes a crucial part in human life, for that reason assuring the quality of web application is very serious. This research will implement defect prediction on the petstore web application with other project datasets. CK OO metric is employed as the parameter. Naive bayes algorithm is an effortless and successful algorithm for predicting defect on software. The objective of this research is to apply naive bayes algorithm in cross-project defect prediction for the web application using pandas and scikit-learn. The outcome of this research is naive bayes algorithm has an good accuracy level of 72.30% - 89.30% and slightly low false alarm around by 5% - 26.67%. However, it has low precision and recall score, around 12,5% - 25% and 20%-60%. Then, naive bayes algorithm predicting more defect module on software than code review. © 2018 IEEE.","CK OO metric; Cross-project defect prediction; Defect prediction; Naive bayes","Classifiers; Defects; Forecasting; Quality assurance; Security of data; Software testing; CK OO metric; Defect prediction; Naive bayes; Naive-Bayes algorithm; Precision and recall; Prediction model; Software defects; Software metrices; Big data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kaczanowski, T., (2012) Practical Unit Testing with TestNG AndMockito, , 1st ed. kaczanowscy.pl; Hryszko, J., Madeyski, L., (2017) Software Engineering: Challenges and Solutions, 504; Misirli, A.T., Bener, A., Kale, R., AI-based software defect predictors: Applications and benefits in a case study (2011) AI Mag, 32 (2), pp. 57-68; Bahaweres, R.B., Zawawi, K., Khairani, D., Hakiem, N., Analysis of statement branch and loop coverage in software testing with genetic algorithm (2017) 2017 4th Int.

Such diversity of technologies results in the need to have special skills in order to reach once created behavior for the smart space. In addition, there are many platforms, which allows to interconnect different devices, but only if they fulfill their protocols. All these lead to the idea, that a new, unified approach to the smart devices representation is needed, which allows to represent objects in a compact form by a platform-independent way.

The subject of the work is automatic vehicle identification system (AVI) making use of passive ultra-high frequency radio frequency identification (UHF RFID) under EPC Class 1 Generation 2 protocol. In the thesis, protocol specifications that affect the probability of successful identification are considered and a simulation model of the communication protocol between RFID tags and the reader is given. The purpose of the thesis is the analysis and modeling of the radio frequency identification protocol standard EPC Class 1 Generation 2. During the diploma work, the EPC Class 1 Generation 2 standard was studied, which describes the technology of passive radio frequency identification, in particular, the communication protocol between tags with the reader, the anticollisional procedure for interrogating tags, access to various areas of tag memory, the reader's operating parameters, security issues. To simplify the description and logical separation of the functional presented in the standard, two levels are introduced: physical and logical. The description of these levels is given in the thesis. For the performance analysis, a model of a radio frequency identification system in Python 3 was developed. The software allows to simulate the procedure of interrogating tags and build and analyze the dependencies of the number of successfully read tags on the settings of the reader based on the model described above. © 2018 IEEE.","cars; identification; Python; reader; RFID; tags","Automatic vehicle identification; High level languages; Identification (control systems); License plates (automobile); Radio waves; Railroad cars; Analysis and modeling; Operating parameters; Performance analysis; Protocol specifications; Python; reader; tags; Ultrahigh-frequency radio-frequency identification (UHF RFID); Radio frequency identification (RFID)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2015) EPC Radio-Frequency Identity Protocols Generation-2 UHF RFID/Ed, , By EPCglobal Inc; Vishnevsky, V.M., Larionov, A.A., Ivanov, R.E., (2016) Analysis and Simulation of UHF RFID Vehicle Identification System /Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS).

We argue that the problems of identifying and predicting trends or entities, as well as the search for technical features, can be solved with the help of easily accessible Big Data technologies, machine learning and predictive analytics, thereby offering an effective plan for development and progress. The purpose of this study is twofold, the first is an identification of technological trends, the second is an identification of application areas and/or that are most promising in terms of technology development and investment. The research was based on methods of clustering, processing of large text files and search queries in patent databases.

This mechanism allows an access point (AP) to reduce contention for the channel in overloaded Wi-Fi networks by limiting the number of stations simultaneously accessing the channel. The 802.11ah AP divides all associated stations into groups and allocates for each group an interval of time, which is called a RAW slot. This paper considers the RAW mechanism with enabled transmissions crossing slot boundaries, which means that a station is allowed to end the current transmission attempt even after a completion of the allocated RAW slot. We present a new mathematical model, which allows estimating throughput and energy consumption with this mechanism, and optimizing performance of RAW. © 2018 IEEE.","802.11ah; cross slot boundary; energy consumption; Restricted Access Window; throughput","Energy utilization; Throughput; Wi-Fi; 802.11ah; Access points; cross slot boundary; Current transmission; New mathematical model; Optimizing performance; Slot-based model; Wi Fi networks; IEEE Standards",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF","The research was done in IITP RAS and supported by the grant # 14-50-00150 of the Russian Science Foundation.",,,,,,,,,,"(2016), IEEE P802.11ah/Standard for Information technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks-Specific requirements-Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications-Amendment 6: Sub 1 GHz License Exempt Operation; Khorov, E., Lyakhov, A., Krotov, A., Guschin, A., A survey on IEEE 802.11 ah: An enabling networking technology for smart cities (2015) Computer Communications, 58, pp. 53-69; Bianchi, G., Performance analysis of the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (2000) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 18 (3), pp. 535-547; Vishnevsky, V.M., Lyakhov, A.I., (2002) IEEE 802.11 Wireless lan: Saturation throughput analysis with seizing effect consideration.Cluster Computing, 5 (2), pp. 133-144; Zheng, L., Cai, L., Pan, J., Ni, M., Performance analysis of grouping strategy for dense IEEE 802.11 networks (2013) Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2013 IEEE, pp. 219-224. , IEEE; Park, C.W., Hwang, D., Lee, T.-J., Enhancement of IEEE 802.11 ah MAC for M2M communications (2014) IEEE Communications Letters, 18 (7), pp. 1151-1154; Hazmi, A., Badihi, B., Larmo, A., Torsner, J., Valkama, M., Performance analysis of iot-enabling IEEE 802.11 ah technology and its RAW mechanism with non-cross slot boundary holding schemes (2015) World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM), 2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on A, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Raeesi, O., Pirskanen, J., Hazmi, A., Levanen, T., Valkama, M., Performance evaluation of IEEE 802.11 ah and its restricted access window mechanism (2014) Communications Workshops (ICC), 2014 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 460-466. , IEEE; Khorov, E., Krotov, A., Lyakhov, A., Modelling machine type communication in IEEE 802.11 ah networks (2015) CommunicationWorkshop (ICCW), 2015 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 1149-1154. , IEEE; Zheng, L., Ni, M., Cai, L., Pan, J., Ghosh, C., Doppler, K., Performance analysis of group-synchronized DCF for dense IEEE 802.11 networks (2014) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 13 (11), pp. 6180-6192; Ghasemiahmadi, M., Li, Y., Cai, L., RSS-based grouping strategy for avoiding hidden terminals with GS-DCF mac protocol (2017) Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), 2017 IEEE, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Nabuuma, H., Alsusa, E., Enhancing the throughput of 802.11 ah sectorized networks using AID-based backoff counters (2017) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC), 2017 13th International, pp. 1921-1926. , IEEE; Tian, L., Khorov, E., Latŕe, S., Famaey, J., Real-time station grouping under dynamic traffic for IEEE 802.11 ah (2017) Sensors, 17 (7), p. 1559; Liu, R.P., Sutton, G.J., Collings, I.B., Power save with offset listen interval for IEEE 802.11 ah smart grid communications (2013) Communications (ICC), 2013 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 4488-4492. , IEEE; Ba, A., Salimi, K., Mateman, P., Boer, P., Van den Heuvel, J., Gloudemans, J., Dijkhuis, J., Bachmann, C., A 4mw-rx 7mw-tx IEEE 802.11 ah fully-integrated RF transceiver (2017) Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium (RFIC), 2017 IEEE, pp. 232-235. , IEEE; Tian, L., Deronne, S., Latŕe, S., Famaey, J., Implementation and validation of an IEEE 802.11 ah module for ns-3 (2016) Proceedings of the Workshop on ns-3, pp. 49-56. , ACM",,,"IEEE Computer Society and its Technical Committee on Computer Communications (TCC);Missouri University of Science and Technology","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19th IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks, WoWMoM 2018","12 June 2018 through 15 June 2018",,139092,,9781538647257,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Since that time, science and technologies have been modernized from slow GPRS networks to the networks of fourth generation, which are allowed to transfer the data wirelessly at the high speed and relatively low latency. However, the technological progress has not being stopped after 4G-networks became widely spread. By now, many scientists talk about principally new technology of wireless data transfer-networks of fifth generation. At the same time it is highly important to assess how the criteria of quality for the modern 5G-networks can be formed, based on the experience of usage 4G-networks. In the paper, it is firstly suggested to assess the quality of the 4G networks. Then, several new factors are introduced for future 5G networks along with the problems that raised during the assessment. Finally, the survey of possible 5G-consumers are conducted to prove the derived hypothesis related to new factors. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","5G; New generation of networks; Quality of service; The provision of services; Wireless networks","4G mobile communication systems; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Quality of service; Queueing networks; Wireless networks; Fourth generation; GPRS network; Low latency; New technologies; Science and Technology; Technological progress; The provision of services; Wireless data transfer; 5G mobile communication systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zhang, X., Cheng, W., Zhang, H., Heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning over 5G mobile wireless networks (2014) IEEE Network, 28 (6), pp. 46-53; Yu, Y., Mobile edge computing towards 5G: Vision, recent progress, open challenges (2016) China Communications, 13 (2), pp. 89-99; 5G Vision (2015) DMC R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Co., 16; (2017) Vision Papers & Roadmaps, , https://5g-ppp.eu/roadmaps, 5G-PPP 5g-ppp.eu [Accessed: 21-Dec-2017]; Tehrani, M., Uysal, M., Yanikomeroglu, H., Device-todevice communication in 5G cellular networks: Challenges, solutions, future directions (2014) IEEE Communications Magazine, 52 (5), pp. 86-92; Malisuwan, S., Milindavanij, D., Kaewphanuekrungsi, W., Quality of Service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) of the 4G LTE perspective (2016) International Journal of Future Computer and Communication, 5 (3), pp. 158-162; Popov, S., Nabokikh, L., MWC 2017: ERA of 5G is right around corner (2017) Last Mile, 2, pp. 62-78; 5G: A Network transformation imperative (2015) Heavy Reading, p. 11; Kostani, A.I., Evaluation of quality of service in 4th generation (4G) Long Term Evolution (LTE) Cellular Data Networks (2013) Universal Journal of Communications and Network, 3 (1), pp. 110-117; (2015) A Deliverable by the NGMN Alliance, , NGMN 5G White Paper; (2017) Tata Consultancy Services | Technology, Digital Solutions, , https://www.tcs.com, Consulting Tcs.com [Accessed: 10-Jan-2017]; (2014) Driving the Convergence on the Physical and Digital Worlds White Paper; Chin, W., Fan, Z., Haines, R., Emerging technologies and research challenges for 5G wireless networks (2014) IEEE Wireless Communications, 21 (2), pp. 106-112; (2015) ERICSSON WHITE PAPER 5G SYSTEMS; Carvalho, M., Gouveia, F., Quality of service in telecommunication networks (2016) Telecommunication Systems and Technologies; Camacho, F., Cárdenas, C., Munõz, D., Emerging technologies and research challenges for intelligent transportation systems: 5g, hetnets, SDN (2017) International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing (IJIDeM); Nakao, A., Du, P., Kiriha, Y., Granelli, F., Gebremariam, A., Taleb, T., Bagaa, M., End-to-end Network Slicing for 5G mobile networks (2017) Journal of Information Processing, 25, pp. 153-163; Patel, S., Chauhan, M., Kapadiya, K., 5G: Future mobile technology-vision 2020 (2012) International Journal of Computer Applications, 54 (17), pp. 6-10; Kim, S., Study on applicability of radio over fiber system for 5g new radio access technology (2016) The Journal of the Korea Institute of Electronic Communication Sciences, 11 (9), pp. 849-854; Liu, G., Jiang, D., 5G: Vision and requirements for mobile communication system towards year 2020 (2016) Chinese Journal of Engineering, 2016, pp. 1-8; Marsch, P., Da Silva, I., Bulakci, O., Tesanovic, M., El Ayoubi, S., Rosowski, T., Kaloxylos, A., Boldi, M., 5G radio access network architecture: Design guidelines and key considerations (2016) IEEE Communications Magazine, 54 (11), pp. 24-32; McTester, L., (2015) 5G White Paper.

In particular, we use an encoder-decoder model of CNN with loss consisting of standard mean squared error and perceptual loss function.

We propose to utilize granular structures and sequentially process granular representations of all frames of the input video. The coarse-grained granules include only low number of the first principal components of deep embeddings. The representation of each frame at finer granularity levels is matched with the representations of photos of only those individuals, for whom the decision at previous levels was reliable. The reliability is checked by thresholding the ratio of distance between reference instance and input frame to the minimal distance. As a result, the photos of all unreliable individuals are not examined anymore for a particular frame at the next levels with finer granularity. Decisions for all frames are united into a candidate set of identities, and the maximal a-posterior final decision is chosen. The experimental study with the LFW, YTF and IJB-A datasets and the state-of-the-art deep embeddings demonstrated that the proposed approach is 2-10 times faster than conventional methods. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Conventional methods; Convolution neural network; First principal components; Granular structuress; Granularity levels; Minimal distance; Sequential analysis; State of the art; Face recognition",,,,,"Health and Safety Executive, HSE: 17-05-0007; National Research University Higher School of Economics, HES; Council on grants of the President of the Russian Federation","VI.

On the other side, the available capacity of such networks varies over time, since the network shall serve also the traffic of primary customers. In the paper, we develop an analytical model to evaluate the performance of various bitrate selection algorithms. We show how to use the model to optimize bitrate selection in heterogeneous networks. © 2018 IEEE.","adaptive bitrate management; CCTV; heterogeneous network; QoS; Wi-Fi","Closed circuit television systems; Heterogeneous networks; Quality of service; Wi-Fi; Wireless networks; Analytical studies; Available capacity; Bit rates; Closed circuit television; Public networks; Real-time video streams; Selection algorithm; Video generation; Television networks",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 16-19-10687","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The research was done at IITP RAS and supported by the Russian Science Foundation (agreement No 16-19-10687).",,,,,,,,,,"(2014) Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), , 2nd ed., ISO/IEC 23009; (2017) Cisco Visual Networking Index: Forecast and Methodology, 2016-2021, , Cisco White Paper; Wang, Y., Survey of objective video quality measurements (2006) Computer Science Faculty Publications, , Department of Computer Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute; Bankov, D., Khorov, E., Lyakhov, A., Fast quality assessment of videos transmitted over lossy networks (2014) Proceedings of International Conference on Engineering and Telecommunication (EnT), , Moscow, November; (2017) Mobile Video Service Performance Study, , HUAWEI White Paper, June; Romero, L., (2011) A Dynamic Adaptive HTTP Streaming Video Service for Google Android, , Master's thesis, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, October; Spiteri, K., Urgaonkar, R., Sitaraman, R., BOLA: Near-optimal bitrate adaptation for online videos (2016) Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM; Khorov, E., Krasilov, A., Liubogoshchev, M., Tang, S., SEBRA: SAND-enabled bitrate and resource allocation algorithm for networkassisted video streaming (2017) Proceedings of IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications, , Rome, Italy; Essaili, A., Wang, Z., Steinbach, E., Zhou, L., QoE-based crosslayer optimization for uplink video transmission (2015) ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM), 12. , August; Seo, B., Cui, W., Zimmermann, R., An experimental study of video uploading from mobile devices with HTTP streaming (2012) Proceedings of the 3rd Multimedia Systems Conference, pp. 215-225. , Chapel Hill, North Carolina, February; Wilk, S., Zimmermann, R., Effelsberg, W., Leveraging transitions for the upload of user-generated mobile video (2016) Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Mobile Video, , Klagenfurt, Austria, May; Rahman, W., Chung, K., Buffer-based adaptive bitrate algorithm for streaming over HTTP (2015) KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, 9 (11). , November; Pack, C., The output of an M/D/1 queue (1975) Operations Research, 23 (4), pp. 750-760. , July-August; Tanner, J., A derivation of the borel distribution (1961) Biometrika, 48, pp. 222-224. , June","Khorov, E.; Institute for Information Transmission Problems (IITP), Russian Federation; эл. почта: khorov@iitp.ru",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking, BlackSeaCom 2018","4 June 2018 through 7 June 2018",,138580,,9781538670910,,,"English","IEEE Int.

While it is often considered that fully or partially overlapping frame transmissions lead to collision and loss of both frames, in reality, sometimes at least one frame can survive if its receive power is higher than that of another frame by some predefined value. The ability of a device to receive the stronger frame if it comes later than the weaker one is called capture effect. For various devices, the capture effect is manifested in different ways. Specifically, we can distinguish preamble and frame body capture effects. The core contribution of the paper is an original testbed which can be used to study the capture effect for numerous off-the-shelf devices in massive experiments. With this testbed, we show that the majority of existing devices follow the standard and do not capture stronger frames during reception of the body of a weaker frame, which limits the performance of Wi-Fi networks in scenarios with hidden stations. © 2018 IEEE.","Capture effect; experimental testbed; hidden stations; IEEE 802.11ax; USRP","IEEE Standards; Testbeds; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); 802.11ax; Capture effect; Experimental testbed; Hidden station; USRP; Wi-Fi",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 16-19-10687","of the capture effect (or do not consider capture effect at all), in reality in a network we may have devices with different types of capture effects, which raises a question about efficiency of such a network.

This phenomenon dramatically changes the dependence of the electron energy levels on magnetic field. In particular, the freezing of energy levels occurs so the ground energy level of light ions can never reach the lower continuum (become critical), no matter how strong the field is. Therefore, the magnetic field affects the critical nucleus charge Zcr in two ways: i. it makes the electron movement essentially one-dimensional diminishing the value of Zcr; ii. it makes the potential weaker increasing the value of critical charge. The phenomenon of critical charge itself is also discussed. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Their goal is to output 0, if x and y are at least L-close in Hamming distance, and output 1, if x and y are at least U-far in Hamming distance, where L < U are some integer parameters known to both parties. If the Hamming distance between x and y lies in the interval (L, U), they are allowed to output anything. This problem is called the Gap Hamming Distance. In this paper we study public-coin one-sided error communication complexity of this problem. The error with probability at most 1/2 is allowed only for pairs at Hamming distance at least U. In this paper we determine this complexity up to factors logarithmic in L.

This notion was introduced by Vovk and Pavlovic [9]. It turns out that plain stopping time complexity of a binary string x could be equivalently defined as (a) the minimal plain complexity of a Turing machine that stops after reading x on a one-directional input tape; (b) the minimal plain complexity of an algorithm that enumerates a prefix-free set containing x; (c) the conditional complexity C(x|x∗) where x in the condition is understood as a prefix of an infinite binary sequence while the first x is understood as a terminated binary string; (d) as a minimal upper semicomputable function K such that each binary sequence has at most 2n prefixes z such that K(z) &lt; n; (e) as max CX(x) where CX(z) is plain Kolmogorov complexity of z relative to oracle X and the maximum is taken over all extensions X of x.

We show that any expander in which any two distinct vertices have at most one common neighbor can be transformed into a gadget possessing good hitting distributions. We demonstrate that this result is applicable to affine plane expanders and to Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak construction of Ramanujan graphs . In particular, from affine plane expanders we extract a gadget achieving the best known trade-off between the arity of outer function and the size of gadget. More specifically, when this gadget has k bits on input, it admits a simulation theorem for all outer function of arity roughly 2k/2 or less (the same was also known for k-bit Inner Product). In addition we show that, unlike Inner Product, underlying hitting distributions in our new gadget are “polynomial-time listable” in the sense that their supports can be written down in time 2O(k), i.e. in time polynomial in size of gadget’s matrix. We also obtain two results showing that with current technique no better trade-off between the arity of outer function and the size of gadget can be achieved. Namely, we observe that no gadget can have hitting distributions with significantly better parameters than Inner Product or our new affine plane gadget. We also show that Thickness Lemma, a place which causes restrictions on the arity of outer functions in proofs of simulation theorems, is unimprovable. © Alexander Kozachinskiy.","Expanders; Hitting distributions; Simulation theorems","Polynomial approximation; Expanders; Hitting distributions; Inner product; Outer functions; Polynomial-time; Ramanujan graphs; Simulation theorem; Time polynomials; Economic and social effects",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 16-01-00362; Russian Academy of Sciences, RAS: 5-100","Supported in part by RFBR grapnt 16-01-00362 and by the Russian Academic Excellence Project “5-100”.",,,,,,,,,,"Chattopadhyay, A., Kouck, M., Loff, B., Mukhopadhyay, S., (2017) Simulation Theorems Via Pseudorandom Properties, , arXiv preprint; De Rezende, S.F., Nordström, J., Vinyals, M., How limited interaction hinders real communication (and what it means for proof and circuit complexity) (2016) Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2016 IEEE 57th Annual Symposium on, pp. 295-304. , IEEE; Goos, M., Lovett, S., Meka, R., Watson, T., Zuckerman, D., Rectangles are nonnegative juntas (2016) SIAM Journal on Computing, 45 (5), pp. 1835-1869; Göös, M., Pitassi, T., Watson, T., Deterministic communication vs. Partition number (2015) Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2015 IEEE 56th Annual Symposium on, pp. 1077-1088. , IEEE; Göös, M., Pitassi, T., Watson, T., (2017) Query-to-Communication Lifting for Bpp, , arXiv preprint; Hatami, H., Hosseini, K., Lovett, S., Structure of protocols for XOR functions (2016) Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2016 IEEE 57th Annual Symposium on, pp. 282-288. , IEEE; Kushilevitz, E., Nisan, N., (2006) Communication Complexity, , Cambridge University Press; Lubotzky, A., Phillips, R., Sarnak, P., Ramanujan graphs (1988) Combinatorica, 8 (3), pp. 261-277; Raz, R., McKenzie, P., Separation of the monotone nc hierarchy (1997) Foundations of Computer Science, 1997.

To improve the efficiency of Wi-Fi networks in dense deployment, a novel amendment to the Wi-Fi standard, namely IEEE 802.11ax introduces Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). In contrast to legacy Wi-Fi, where performance of a station to a considerable degree depends on rate control, aggregation and other decision-making algorithms implemented at the station, in 11ax networks it is the access point that schedules channel time and specifies transmission parameters for both uplink and downlink. Although OFDMA scheduling in 11ax has much in common with that in cellular networks, e.g. LTE, 11ax has some peculiarities, especially for uplink transmission. Focusing on such peculiarities, in this paper, we investigate the scheduling problem in 11ax, propose a set of schedulers for 11ax, compare their performance and determine the gain achievable by the usage of OFDMA. © 2018 IEEE.","High-Efficiency WLAN; IEEE 802.11ax; OFDMA; QoS-aware Scheduling; Wi-Fi","Decision making; Efficiency; IEEE Standards; Mobile telecommunication systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Scheduling; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; 802.11ax; Decision-making algorithms; High-efficiency; OFDMA; Orthogonal frequency division multiple access; QoS Aware Scheduling; Transmission parameters; Up-link transmissions; Frequency division multiple access",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 16-19-10687","The research was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (agreement No 16-19-10687).",,,,,,,,,,"Sharon, O., Alpert, Y., Scheduling strategies and throughput optimization for the uplink for ieee 802. 11 ax and ieee 802. 11 ac based networks (2017) Wireless Sensor Network, 9 (8), p. 250; Khorov, E., Loginov, V., Lyakhov, A., Several edca parameter sets for improving channel access in ieee 802. 11ax networks (2016) ISWCS 2016.

Advantages and disadvantages of mesh and torus topologies usage, and the effect, achieved by their application to various implementations of networks on chip, are analyzed. Extension of the scope of solutions for standard regular network topologies mesh and torus on the circulant topologies with better characteristics is proposed.

An example of practical application of software with pattern recognition is offered. The paper examines the impact of virtual reality on human health, as well as the problem of assimilation of educational material in preschool education.

An objective is, by reconstructing the spatial microwave scattering density on the scene, to detect the presence and the nature of road obstacles impeding driving in the near vehicle zone. The idea of holographic visualization is to reconstruct the spatial microwave scattering density of an object by detecting an amplitude and phase of a reflected signal by lattice of sensors. We discuss versions of an algorithm, determine and analyse its resolution limits for various distances with different number of sensors for a one-dimensional test problem of detecting two walls (or posts) separated by a gap at a fixed distance. The maximal interval between sensors needed for a reliable reconstruction equals approximately Fresnel zone width. We show that maximal resolution achieved by our algorithm with an appropriate number of sensors was about 40% of Fresnel zone width for wall detection and about 30% of zone width for gap detection. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,,,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 16-19-00181","We thank the Russian Science Foundation, project number 16-19-00181, for supporting this work.",,,,,,,,,,"Fu, L., Gui, Y.S., Bai, L.H., Guo, H., Abou-Rachid, H., Hu, C.-M., (2015) J.

We use well-sampled light curves based on mostly our own observations to find and identify deviations (inhomogeneities) from broken power law. By the inhomogeneous behavior we mean flashes, bumps, slow deviations from power law (wiggles) in a light curve. In particular we report parameters of broken power law, describe phenomenology, compare optical light curves with X-ray ones and classify the inhomogeneities. We show that the duration of the inhomogeneities correlates with their peak time relative to gamma-ray burst (GRB) trigger and the correlation is the same for all types of inhomogeneities. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","afterglow; bumps; flares; Gamma-ray bursts; inhomogeneous behavior; wiggles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beuermann, K., (1999) Astron.

In a few cases, we have found and investigated precursor candidates using SPI-ACS, SPI and IBIS/ISGRI of INTEGRAL, GBM and LAT of Fermi data. No convincing evidence for the existence of precursors of short GRBs has been found. A statistical analysis of the averaged light curve for the sample of brightest short bursts has revealed no regular precursor.

A topical problem of the kind is designing file managers with a NL-interface. The principal attention in our previous papers was paid to creating new, more effective theoretical foundations of designing semantic parsers of NL-instructions. In particular, we suggested in a very concise form an original and broadly applicable algorithm of semantic parsing. This paper, firstly, illustrates a correspondence between input instructions and their semantic representations. Secondly, the main attention is given to describing mathematical foundations of executing NL-instructions by computer systems. The methodological basis for these results is the theory of K-representations (knowledge representations). Its basic formal model introduces a system consisting of ten partial operations on conceptual structures. There are solid grounds for conjecturing that, combining these operations in arbitrary order, it is possible and convenient to build step by step a semantic representation of arbitrarily complex sentence or discourse in NL. The stated theoretical results have become the basis for designing a file manager with a NL-interface NLC-2 (Natural Language Commander - Version Two). © 2018 Croatian Society MIPRO.","execution of instruction; integral formal semantics of natural language; relation of correspondence to a pattern; semantic parsing; SK-language","Formal methods; Knowledge representation; Managers; Microelectronics; Semantics; Syntactics; execution of instruction; Formal Semantics; relation of correspondence to a pattern; Semantic parsing; SK-language; Natural language processing systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artzi, Y., Zettlemoyer, L., Weakly supervised learning of semantic parsers for mapping instructions to actions (2013) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 49-62. , https://aclweb.org/anthology/Q/Q13/Q13-1005.pdf, Action Editor: Jason Eisner, retrieved: 2016-03-13; Babes-Vroman, M., MacGlashan, J., Gao, R., Winner, K., Adjogah, R., DesJardins, M., Liftman, M., Muresan, S., Learning to interpret natural language instructions (2012) Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Semantic Interpretation in An Actionable Context, pp. 1-6. , https://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W12/W12-2801.pdf, Montreal, Canada, June 3-8, retrieved: 2016-03-13; Bastianelli, E., Castellucci, C., Croce, D., Basili, R., Textual inference and meaning representation in human robot interaction (2013) Proceedings of the Joint Symposium on Semantic Processing.

The size of microprocessor specifications is measured in thousands lines of code. Consequently, their maintenance requires significant effort. Typical maintenance activities include regular updates, substitution of deprecated functionality, and support for new revisions and implementation-defined features. Our team is working on MicroTESK, a tool that generates test programs for microprocessors based on specifications of the instruction set architectures. The specifications are created in a specialized language, called nML, extended with facilities to manage revision-specific and implementation-defined features. The tool has been applied to ARMv8, MIPS64, PowerPC, RISC-V, and x86 microprocessors. This paper describes our experience in maintaining specifications and the approach we use to simplify this process. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computer architecture; Specifications; Test facilities; Testing; Van de Graaff generators; Functional verification; Instruction set architecture; Lines of code; Maintenance activity; PowerPC; Test program; Software testing",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ: 15-07-03834","The authors would like to thank Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR).

The openness to trade with other nations plays a very significant role in strengthening the economy of a country. This happens through two-way flow of resources to augment or complement each other’s basic needs. It can also be an exchange of everyday use items in case of surplus production. In the majority of the countries, this exchange / entry and exit of goods are handled by the Customs departments of those countries. This work is intended to take a detailed look at a fundamental trade issue faced by the trade community: corruption in the customs departments at national and international levels. This study aims to describe the specifics of corruption in the customs service; helps justify the theoretical and practical importance of the issue under study. A study of prevailing anti-corruption measures being taken and their effectiveness assessment is carried out. The study also includes the main models of assessment of corruption in customs.

It is emphasized that the ratio of acid oxides contained in the charge to the main oxides is the main factor influencing the operational resistance of mineral fibers, as well as the energy intensity of their production. A hy-pothesis has been put forward and confirmed that the operational resistance of a fiber depends on the content of heavy metals (their oxides) in the ini-tial charge. Determination of the elemental composition of stone wool samples was carried out by X-ray fluorescence analysis. Conducted sam-ples with a different acidity module of the study, show, that the fibers are safe by radiation indices, and their operational resistance can be affected by heavy metal oxides. It is substantiated that the durability of building systems in which mineral wool products are used as thermal insulation is determined by the properties of mineral wool products, the literacy of de-sign solutions and the quality of installation. The properties of mineral wool products, including their operational resistance, depend on the prop-erties of mineral fibers and the observance of technological regimes both on the fact of the most complete curing of the binder and on the features of formation of the volume-oriented structure of the mineral wool carpet. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Fluorescence; Heavy metals; Mineral wool; Thermal insulation; Urban growth; Wool; X rays; Yarn; Building systems; Elemental compositions; Energy intensity; Heavy metal oxides; Natural radioactivity; Oriented structure; Technological regime; X ray fluorescence analysis; Minerals",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rumyantsev, B., Zhukov, A., Smirnova, T., (2014) Internet-Vestnik VolgGASU., 4, p. 3; Zhukov, A., Smirnova, T., Zelenshchikov, D., Khimich, A., (2014) Adv.

Public-private partnership is one of the most widespread format of interaction between the state and business. The article analyzes the legal foundations and trends in the development of this form of interaction. Modern methods for assessing risks, benefits and effects for different stakeholders of projects implemented in the form of PPPs are considered. The authors propose their approach to building a financial model and assessing the effects of PPP projects. Taking into account risks, the fair price of participation in the PPP project for both parties is estimated. The proposed financial model can be used to calculate the concession fee in tariff-regulated projects where the state is supposed to participate, usually with the subsequent transfer of the ownership for the created object to the state. The results of the work can be used by departmental and regional centers of public-private partnerships, by specialists of private investor companies and tariff regulation bodies when formulating the financial and economic justification for public-private partnership projects, justifying its preference in comparison with other forms of state budget investments. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Budget control; Finance; Laws and legislation; Mergers and acquisitions; Privatization; Risk perception; Urban growth; Economic justification; Financial modeling; Ppp projects; Private investors; Property management; Public private partnerships; State budgets; Tariff regulation; Risk assessment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Polyakova, A., Vasilyeva, E., Procedia Engineering, 165, pp. 1380-1387; Sagalyn, L.B., (2007) Journal of the American Planning Association, 73 (1), pp. 7-22; Mottaeva, A., (2017) MATEC Web of Conferences, 106, p. 08071; Mottaeva, A., (2017) MATEC Web of Conferences, 106, p. 08072; Polyakova, I., Chibisova, E., (2016) Economy and Entrepreneurship, 5 (70), pp. 579-582; Polyakova, I., Vasilyeva, E., (2017) Economy and Entrepreneurship, 42 (812), pp. 1024-1028; Makovšek, D., (2013) Journal of Transport Economics and Policy (JTEP), 47 (1), pp. 143-155; Caperchione, E., Demirag, I., Grossi, G., (2017) Accounting Forum, 411, pp. 1-7; Buso, M., Marty, F., TraTran, P., (2017) International Journal of Industrial Organization, 51, pp. 56-84; Burke, R., Demirag, I., (2017) Accounting Forum, 41 (1), pp. 28-43; Benitez-Avila, C., (2018) International Journal of Project Management, 36 (3), pp. 429-443; Diaz, G., (2017) Utilities Policy, 48, pp. 109-121; Kweun, J., Wheeler, P., Gifford, J.L., (2018) Transport Policy, 62, pp. 12-20; Kim, Y.-J., (2018) Cities, 72, pp. 43-50; Klijn, A., Teisman, G., (2003) Public Money and Management, 2 (3), pp. 137-146; Mottaeva, A., (2017) IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 90 (1), p. 012124; Mottaeva, A., (2017) MATEC Web of Conferences, 106, p. 08071; Mottaeva, A., (2017) MATEC Web of Conferences, 106, p. 08072; Kolmakov, V., (2015) Modern Scientific Research and Innovation, 953, p. 196; Radoushinsky, A., (2016) Scientific and Technical Lists of the St, 5 (251), pp. 57-71. , Petersburg State Polytechnic University.

The collimation is due to the magnetic force produced by the toroidal component of the solar/stellar magnetic field. The collimation leads to formation of a two-jet structure and change of topology of the heliopause. Tube-like shape of the heliopause/astropause is formed instead of the commonly accepted sheet-like shape. Three different situations are explored in this paper: (1) the Sun/star is at the rest with respect to local interstellar medium (LISM), (2) the Sun/star moves with respect to fully ionized LISM, (3) the Sun/star moves with respect to partially ionized LISM. 3D non-dissipative MHD model results have shown that the tube-like structure is formed in the first two cases. The thickness of the heliosheath depends on the model parameters strongly. The case of the partially ionized LISM is the most realistic one for the heliosphere. In this case the collimation towards the solar poles is also observed in the results of 3D kinetic-MHD modeling. However, the tube-like structure of the heliopause is not seen in the numerical results. We argue that this is due to charge exchange between proton and H atom components that results in displacement of the stagnation points in further downwind of the Sun. Note also that dissipative effects (e.g. reconnection at the current sheet in the non-stationary heliosphere) or instabilities could destroy the effects of the solar wind collimation. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Such a problem is especially crucial in mobile ad hoc networks, dense networks, networks of vehicles and drones, sensor networks. In other words, this problem occurs in any scenario with frequent changes in topology or interference level on one side and with strong requirements on delay, reliability, power consumption, or capacity on the other side. If the control information changes partially, it may be worth sending only differential updates instead of messages containing full information to reduce overhead. However, such an approach needs accurate tuning of dissemination parameters, since it is necessary to guarantee information relevance in error-prone wireless networks. In the paper, we provide a deep study of two approaches for generating differential updates - namely, incremental and cumulative - and compare their efficiency. We show that the incremental approach allows significantly reducing the amount of generated control information compared to the cumulative one, while providing the same level of information relevance. We develop an analytical model for the incremental approach and propose an algorithm which allows tuning its parameters, depending on the number of nodes in the network, their mobility, and wireless channel quality. Using the developed analytical model, we show that the incremental approach is very useful for static dense network deployments and networks with low and medium mobility, since it allows us to significantly reduce the amount of control information compared to the classical full dump approach. © 2018 IEEE.","control information dissemination; dense deployment; differential update; full dump; Wireless multihop networks","Analytical models; Sensor networks; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Control information; dense deployment; differential update; full dump; Wireless multi-hop network; Information dissemination",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 14-50-00150","The research was done at IITP RAS and supported by the Russian Science Foundation (agreement No 14-50-00150).",,,,,,,,,,"Clausen, T., Jacquet, P., Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR), RFC, 3626; Kosek-Szott, K., Natkaniec, M., Szott, S., Krasilov, A., Lyakhov, A., Safonov, A., Tinnirello, I., (2013) What's New for QoS in IEEE 802. 11, IEEE Network, 27 (6), pp. 95-104; Khorov, E., Kiryanov, A., Krotov, A., Gallo, P., Garlisi, D., Tinnirello, I., Joint usage of dynamic sensitivity control and time division multiple access in dense 802. 11 ax networks (2016) International Workshop on Multiple Access Communications, pp. 57-71. , Springer; Afaqui, M.S., Garcia-Villegas, E., Lopez-Aguilera, E., Camps-Mur, D., Dynamic sensitivity control of access points for IEEE 802. 11 ax (2016) Communications (ICC), 2016 IEEE International Conference On, IEEE, pp. 1-7; Kim, T.-S., Lim, H., Hou, J.C., Improving spatial reuse through tuning transmit power, carrier sense threshold, and data rate in multihop wireless networks (2006) Proc. the 12th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, ACM, pp. 366-377; Panichpapiboon, S., Pattara-Atikom, W., A review of information dissemination protocols for vehicular ad hoc networks (2012) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 14 (3), pp. 784-798; Fakhriev, D., Nekrasov, P., Forwarding protocol for multi-channel narrowband ad hoc networks (2013) Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2013-2013 IEEE, IEEE, pp. 516-520; Borgonovo, F., Capone, A., Cesana, M., Fratta, L., RR-ALOHA, a Reliable R-ALOHA broadcast channel for ad-hoc inter-vehicle communication networks (2002) Proceedings of Med-Hoc-Net; Huang, Y., Bhatti, S.N., Parker, D., Tuning OLSR (2006) Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, 2006 IEEE 17th International Symposium On, IEEE, pp. 1-5; 802. 11-2012-IEEE Standard for Information Technology-Telecommunications and Information Exchange between Systems Local and Metropolitan Area Networks-Specific Requirements Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications; Khorov, E., Krasilov, A., Krotov, A., Lyakhov, A., Will MCCA revive wireless multihop networks (2017) Computer Communications, 104, pp. 159-174; Ivanov, A., Khorov, E., Lyakhov, A., Solomatin, I., Modeling joint usage of random and deterministic channel access in Wi-Fi networks (2016) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC), 2016 International, IEEE, pp. 898-903; Belogaev, A., Khorov, E., Krasilov, A., Lyakhov, A., Study of the groupbased approach to disseminate control information in wireless networks (2015) Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS), 2015 International Symposium On, IEEE, pp. 621-625; Belogaev, A., Khorov, E., Krasilov, A., Lyakhov, A., Study of the enhanced algorithm for control information dissemination in Wi-Fi Mesh networks (2016) Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), 2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium On, IEEE, pp. 1-6; Perkins, C.E., Bhagwat, P., Highly dynamic destination-sequenced distance-vector routing (DSDV) for mobile computers (1994) ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 24, pp. 234-244; Ogier, R., Spagnolo, P., Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Extension of OSPF Using Connected Dominating Set (CDS) Flooding, RFC, 5614; Wang, Z., Chen, Y., Li, C., A new loop-free proactive source routing scheme for opportunistic data forwarding in wireless networks (2011) IEEE Communications Letters, 15 (11), pp. 1184-1186",,"Gerla M.Idzikowski F.Rosenberg C.Kaneko M.Secci S.Mnaouer A.B.Achir N.","","IEEE Computer Society","10th Annual Wireless Days Conference, WD 2018","3 April 2018 through 5 April 2018",,136613,21569711,9781538656327,,,"English","IFIP Wirel.

This makes an interesting case because online media had spread and established a parallel political agenda in Russia in the 2000s, before the onset of regulations. The focus of this study is the contents and dynamics of media coverage of Internet regulation in Russia over years, particularly the topics covered and the countries involved. It uses topic modeling and social network analysis to analyze 6,140 texts from Russia's largest mass media collection. The automatic modeling approach helps obtain reproducible evidence on the structure and actors of the otherwise highly politicized discourse. The study demonstrated, first, the growing interest of Russian media to Internet regulation, with comparable shares of state-controlled and private media in this discourse. Second, it revealed the structure of 50 topics arranging into nine clusters, from gambling to international relations, with one dominant network segment spanning over five clusters. Third, it identified groups of countries by their appearance in the texts and co-appearance in one text as 'communities' of countries that can 'put on the map' the discourse on certain topics of Internet regulation in Russia. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Such taxies have a well specified path to travel. Therefore, these vehicles only required two important parameters. One is detection parameter and other is control parameter. Further, detection parameters require turn detection and obstacle detection. The control parameters contain steering control and speed control. In this paper a novel autonomous taxi model has been proposed for smart city scenario. Deep learning has been used to model the human driver capabilities for the autonomous taxi. A hierarchical Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture has been utilized to train various driving aspects. In first level, the proposed DNN architecture classifies the straight and turning of road. A parallel DNN is used to detect obstacle at level one. In second level, the DNN discriminates the turning i.e. left or right for steering and speed controls. Two multi layered DNNs have been used on Nvidia Tesla K 40 GPU based system with Core i-7 processor. The mean squared error (MSE) for the detection parameters viz. speed and steering angle were 0.018 and 0.0248 percent, respectively, with 15 milli seconds of real-time response delay. © 2018 IEEE.","Autonomous Taxi; Deep Learning; Driver assistance systems; Lane detection; Smart City formatting","Automobile drivers; Automobile steering equipment; Deep learning; Internet of things; Mean square error; Network architecture; Obstacle detectors; Smart city; Speed control; Taxicabs; Autonomous Taxi; Control parameters; Driver assistance system; Lane detection; Mean squared error; Obstacle detection; Real time response; Steering control; Deep neural networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Weber, M., (2014) Where To?

The most acceptable way of measuring such physical quantities in obtaining reliable results is the electromechanical modulation (interruption)of the oncoming gas flow by means of flow interrupters, which allows obtaining the required higher amplification of the signal of the modulated signal, it is easy to separate the modulated signal from the unmodulated noise and interference signal, even if the level of the useful signal is lower than the level of noise and interference. Successful in solving such a problem is the use of signal accumulation, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio at the converter output. The paper presents the results of an investigation of a high-speed pressure transducer for a gas medium of low density. The stability of the metrological characteristics of the converter is investigated using the method of probabilistic study of the stability of the output characteristic of a membrane-capacitive converter to determine the optimum frequency of electromechanical transformation and to ensure the specified accuracy and stability of its metrological characteristics, taking into account the random nature of the deviation of structural and electrophysical parameters associated with destabilizing factors and technological factors. © 2018 IEEE.","High accuracy; Measurement; Optimization options; Physical quantity; Small signal; Stability","Aerodynamics; Convergence of numerical methods; Density of gases; Flow of gases; Manufacture; Measurement; Signal to noise ratio; Stability; Transducers; Electrophysical parameters; High-accuracy; Measuring transducers; Metrological characteristics; Output characteristics; Physical quantities; Technological factors; Transfer characteristics; Gases",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kuligin, M., Minimization of the error of the analog tract of the geophysical data collection system (2015) Measuring Technique, 9, pp. 10-13; Kaverin, A., Pecheritsa, D., Evaluation of the accuracy characteristics of the equipment for recording and reproducing signals from space navigation systems (2015) Measuring Technique, (10), pp. 8-11; Tumakova, E.O., Control over the influence of external factors affecting on the functioning of electromechanical systems (2016) Measuring Technique, (6), pp. 33-36; Lomakin, M., Mironov, A., Shestopalova, O., Multimodal processing of measurement information in intelligent systems for forecasting the reliability of space vehicles (2014) Measuring Technique, (1), pp. 8-13; Mazda, F., (1987) Electronic Instruments and Measurement Techniques, , Cambridge University Press; Fraden, J., (2004) Handbook of Modern Sensors.

At the present time, the theme of surrogate motherhood is highly deliberated not only in Russia but also abroad. Despite the fact that there is a clear worldwide trend of legalizing the service, the question of its legitimization and normalization remains open. In that regard, there is a need for sociological research covering various aspects of surrogate motherhood. The reports presented at the round table were devoted to the complex, multifaceted consideration of the surrogate motherhood market. The participants' presentations covered a wide range of topics, starting with the adjustment policies of the medical service and constructing a discourse around it, and ending with an overview of the potential risks to the well-being of children born with the help of surrogate programs. Some reports also included the first results of empirical research which allowed participants to focus on the specifics of surrogate motherhood in Russian society. The aim of the round table was to clarify the specifics and the problems of surrogate motherhood in Russia, as well as to determine the vectors of sociological research in this field.

The research is based on the data from two surveys of manufacturing companies performed in 2005 and 2009. The findings show beneficial effects of importing on innovation. Previous involvement in the importation of equipment and intermediates leads to future innovation, and there is evidence of simultaneous choice in favour of imports and innovation in case of manufacturing equipment. The learning effects from importing seem to be higher for product than for process innovation. The decisions of firms to invest in innovation and to import are sensitive to their location, technology position, pressure from import competition, and their efforts to conduct R&D in addition to importing embodied knowledge. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"decision making; import; innovation; knowledge; manufacturing; research and development; survey; Russian Federation",,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; National Research University Higher School of Economics, ВШЭ","This work was supported by the National Research University-Higher School of Economics under the Basic Research Program, and by the FP7 Collaborative SEARCH Research Project “Sharing Knowledge Assets: Interregionally Cohesive Neighbourhoods”.

Unlike traditional streams, tournament broadcasts lack a streamer figure to which spectators can appeal directly. Using topic modelling and cross-correlation analysis of more than 3 million messages from 86 games of TI7, we uncover main topical and temporal patterns of communication. First, we disentangle contextual meanings of emotes and memes, which play a salient role in communication, and show a meta-topics semantic map of streaming slang. Second, our analysis shows a prevalence of the event-driven game communication during tournament broadcasts and particular topics associated with the event peaks.

However, very few of them address both of them simultaneously. In this paper, we introduced a new method not only to detect and localize the abnormalities in crowded scenes but also to determine the class of abnormality. In This work, we used Histogram of Oriented Gradient to extract the features. Afterwards, we developed a model for each abnormality class based on structured output logistic regression. Using template matching scheme, those regions with maximum detection scores will be chosen as regions which contain abnormality. Aiming to increase model's precision, an iterative hard negative mining has been utilized. Such method was not applicable unless we had general and application free definition for abnormality. Regarding this, we defined a general abnormality definition. The proposed approach shows significant improvements in results over other state-of-the-art approaches. © 2017 IEEE.","Abnormality Analysis; Computer Vision; Crowd Scene Analysis; Hard Negative Mining","Graphic methods; Iterative methods; Template matching; Abnormality Analysis; Anomaly detection; Crowd scenes; Histogram of oriented gradients; Logistic regressions; Negative minings; Sliding Window; State-of-the-art approach; Computer vision",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Benabbas, Y., Ihaddadene, N., Djeraba, C., Motion pattern extraction and event detection for automatic visual surveillance (2011) Journal on Image and Video Processing, 7, pp. 1-15; Vedaldi, A., Zisserman, A., Structured output regression for detection with partial occlusion (2009) NIPS; Felzenszwalb, P.F., Grishick, R.B., McAllister, D., Ramanan, D., Object detection with discriminatively trained part based models (2009) PAMI; Blaschko, M.B., Lampert, C.H., Learning to localize objects with structured output regression (2008) Proc.

According to theory for triangular antiferromagnets with a weak random modulation of the exchange bonds, this is a result of the competition between the structural and dynamic disorders. The dynamic zero-point or thermal fluctuations are known to lift the degeneracy of the mean field ground state of a triangular antiferromagnet and cause the spin configuration to be the most collinear, while the static disorder provides another selection of the ground state, with the least collinear structure. Low-level doping (x ≤ 0.15) was found to decrease the Néel temperature and saturation field by only few percent, while the magnetisation plateau disappears completely and the spin configuration is drastically changed. ESR spectra confirm an impurity-induced change of the so-called Y-Type structure to an inverted Y-structure for x = 0.15. For x = 0.075 the intermediate regime with the decrease of width and weakening of flattening of 1/3-plateau was found. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Antiferromagnetic materials; Dynamics; Electrospinning; Ground state; Iron compounds; Low temperature effects; Magnetic moments; Magnetization; Molybdenum compounds; Potassium compounds; Rubidium compounds; Spin fluctuations; Temperature; Ground-state spins; Intermediate regimes; Saturation fields; Spin configurations; Structural disorders; Thermal fluctuations; Triangular lattice; Two Dimensional (2 D); Electron spin resonance spectroscopy",,,,,"Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; Russian Foundation for Fundamental Investigations: N 15-02-05918; Osaka University; Russian Science Foundation: N 17-1201505","The work is supported by the Russian Foundation for Fundamental research, grant N 15-02-05918, Russian Science Foundation, grant N 17-1201505, by the Program of the Presidium of Russian Academy of Sciences, and by International Joint Research Promotion Program (short term) in Osaka University.",,,,,,,,,,"Collins, M.F., Petrenko, O.A., (1997) Can.

Its ground state is a nonmagnetic singlet separated from the triplet excitations by an energy gap of approximately 1 meV. This compound allows partial substitution of chlorine ions by bromine, which results in the modulation of the affected exchange bonds. We have found by means of electron spin resonance spectroscopy that this doping results in the formation of the gapless S = 1 paramagnetic centers.

The paper proposes a model for calculating the reliability of a wireless sensor telecommunication system for monitoring the gas transmission network state, allowing the performance of the required probability level of failure-free operation when a certain number of wireless sensor modules fail. The reliability calculation of the system includes two stages: The module reliability and the reliability of the radio channel for transmitting information. The application technique for the Monte Carlo simulation method calculation is described. Since nowadays there are no known unified means for designing and building wireless STS, the paper proposes the main process stages of designing wireless sensor telecommunication networks using a well-known mathematical apparatus.

Digital technologies can significantly reduce the production time and reduce its costs, and digital modeling of processes significantly reduces the number of field tests and experiments. The development of new methods of technical and economic audit predetermines the need to create and justify the most common and objective criteria and evaluation indicators at the design stage of satellite equipment. In order to increase the service life of space vehicles, it is proposed to calculate the possible consequences of electrostatic discharges at the design design stage and provide recommendations for reducing their negative impact. In the studies, a new method for calculating interference from electrostatic discharges in the on-board cable network of spacecrafts is considered. The method makes it possible to reduce the complexity of calculating the spreading of currents along the surface of spacecraft by 2-3 orders of magnitude. The method is based on the idea of building macromodels built on the basis of explicit and implicit methods of Euler. The error in the application of the method is 1%, which is quite acceptable at the stage of preliminary design. © 2018 IEEE.","efficiency increase; electrification; Euler methods; geoinformation systems; macromodeling","Cables; Complex networks; Efficiency; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatics; Equivalent circuits; Mineral exploration; Mineral industry; Spacecraft; Efficiency increase; electrification; Euler method; Geo-information; Macromodeling; Geographic information systems",,,,,,"A lot of organizations in different countries deal with issues and developing formal standards in the field of spatial information.

For such systems design debugging by simulation it is necessary to generate the minimal complete, in the sense of a particular criteria, set of tests for applying to the simulated system to verify the correctness of functioning. Digital control systems are simulated on the logic level of the signals they exchange with external environment, including controlled object. As input data for the simulation input interactions are used, comprising both the actual input signals and output exchange control signals. We consider control digital systems the functioning of which can be represented in the form of a sequence of functions from a finite alphabet. For the development of projects of such systems by the modeling method, it is necessary to form a minimum complete, in the sense of a certain criterion, set of test actions for the simulated system to verify the correctness of its functioning. Control digital systems are modeled at the level of the logical signals that they exchange with the external environment, including those with managed objects. Inputs for simulation are input interactions which include both the actual input signals and the output control signals of the exchange.

New capacities lead to creation of various systems for integration of smart things into Social Networks of the Internet of Things. One of the relevant trends in artificial intelligence is the technology of recognizing the natural language of a human. New insights in this topic can lead to new means of natural human-machine interaction, in which the machine would learn how to understand human's language, adjusting and interacting in it. One of such tools is voice assistant, which can be integrated into many other intelligent systems.

The wide dissemination of IoT technologies into various industries, such as agriculture and mining, reveals data transfer issues in geographically remote locations due to absence of any network infrastructure. Several technologies like LoraWAN and NB-IOT offer extended communication ranges, however they still cannot fully solve the problem. In many cases satellite networks are the only available option for transmitting IoT data to a central collection point. Our research of satellite networks showed that as of today the Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD) network is one of the best technologies suited for IoT applications. However, the SBD imposes a significant limit on the size of transmitted messages, which turns data format selection into a vitally important task. We developed a simulation model as well as a heterogeneous Iridium-LoRAWAN prototype to compare different data exchange formats. Our experiments showed more than 4 times increase in the amount of data transferred with Protocol Buffers, compared to the widely used JSON format. © 2018 IEEE.","data exchange formats; Internet of Things; Iridium; LoraWAN; Protobuf; satellite networks","Data transfer; Electronic data interchange; Heterogeneous networks; Internet of things; Iridium; Satellites; Communication range; Data exchange format; Data interchange format; Internet of thing (IOT); LoraWAN; Network infrastructure; Protobuf; Satellite network; Data communication systems",,,,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics, ВШЭ: 17-05-0017","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The article was prepared within the framework of the Academic Fund Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) in 2017 (grant №17-05-0017) and by the Russian Academic Excellence Project «5-100».",,,,,,,,,,"Satellite Technologies for IoT Applications/IoTUK, , https://iotuk.org.uk/wpcontent/uploads/2017/04/Satellite-Applications.pdf, Home - IoTUK , (accessed 15.10.2017); LPWAN White Paper / Leverge, , https://www.leverege.com/researchpapers/lpwan-white-paper, Leverge, (accessed 15.10.2017); Introducing JSON / JSON, , http://www.json.org, JSON, (accessed 15.10.2017); BSON - Binary JSON / BSON, , http://bsonspec.org, BSON, (accessed 15.10.2017); Bormann, C., Hoffman, P., Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), , https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), (accessed 15.10.2017); Furuhashi, S., MessagePack, , http://msgpack.org, MessagePack, (accessed 15.10.2017); JSON Compressor and Decompressor, , https://github.com/tcorral/JSONC, tcorral, Github, (accessed 15.10.2017); Protocol Buffers / Google Developers, , https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/, Google Developers , (accessed 15.10.2017); (2017) LoRaWAN 1.0.2 Regional Parameters, , LoRa Alliance Technical committee // LoRa Alliance; Noreen, U., Bounceur, A., Clavier, L., Modeling Interference for Wireless Sensor Network Simulators, , http://pagesperso.univbrest.fr/-bounceur/anr/persepteur/articles/bdaw-2016-umber.pdf, Universitè de Bretagne Occidentale , (accessed 15.10.2017); Iridium 9602 SBD Transceiver Developer's Guide, , https://github.com/whitef0x0/week1example/blob/master/iridiumsbd/Iridium-9602-SBD-Transceiver-Product-Developers-Guide.pdf, Iridium Communications Inc., Iridium Communications Inc., (accessed 15.10.2017); (2012) Iridium Short Burst Data Service Developers Guide, , Iridium Satellite // Iridium Satellite LLC; The LoRa Server Project, , https://docs.loraserver.io/lora-gateway-bridge/use/data/, LoRa Server documentation, The LoRa Server project, (accessed 15.10.2017); Language Guide (proto3), , https://developers.google.com/protocolbuffers/docs/proto3, Google Developers , Google Developers, (accessed 15.10.2017)","Lysogor, I.I.; Adygeya State UniversityRussian Federation",,"IEEE Russia Central Section;National Instruments R and D;National Research University ""Higher School of Economics"";Russian Foundation for Basic Research","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st Moscow Workshop on Electronic and Networking Technologies, MWENT 2018","14 March 2018 through 16 March 2018",,135880,,9781538634974,,,"English","Mosc.

Initially, it rises quickly to some value and instead of dropping subsequently by several orders of magnitude it continues to increase further. Such behavior mitigates electron charging effects. This observation combined with the high DEH:PC radiation resistance and its acceptable temperature range makes it very promising as a spacecraft thermal blanket material. © 2018 IEEE.","mitigates electron charging effects; molecularly doped polycarbonate; Radiation-induced conductivity","Polycarbonates; Electron charging; Hydrazones; Orders of magnitude; Radiation induced conductivity; Radiation resistance; Temperature range; Temporal dependence; Thermal blanket; Radiation effects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Garrett, H.B., Whittlesey, A., Guide to mitigating spacecraft charging effects (2011) Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology, p. 240; Mitigating in space charging effects-a guideline NASA Handbook 4002A; Balmain, K.G., Dubois, G.R., Surface discharges in teflon, mylar and kapton (1979) IEEE Trans.Nucl.

This model has to consider effects of corners that circuit developers could imitate most precisely practical circuits at their design. The purpose of this paper is to develop compact SPICE models for standard configurations of LSI interconnections. For achievement of this goal the interconnection model in the form of the distributed RC circuit is used. Proceeding from potential distribution along the interconnection, his model parameters-resistance and the capacity of RC circuit links are calculated that allows to consider influence of bends on interconnection electric properties. For simplification of interconnection model and reduction of a counting duration the multi-sectional RC model is reduced in the compact Pi-shaped equivalent circuit. For each of the main topology the parameters for Pi-shaped equivalent circuits, which give accuracy in the frequency parameters of 98% on a phase and 93% on amplitude, are calculated. Upon transition to the Pi-shaped equivalent circuit the CPU time is reduced by 28%. © 2018 IEEE.","electrical model; LSI interconnections; reduction; signal delay in interconnections","Circuit simulation; Electric power system interconnection; Equivalent circuits; Integrated circuits; LSI circuits; Reduction; Timing circuits; Distributed RC; Electrical modeling; Frequency parameters; Interconnection modeling; LSI interconnections; Model parameters; Potential distributions; Signal delays; Integrated circuit interconnects",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 18-07-00898 A.; National Research University Higher School of Economics, HES: TZ-94","This paper was submitted for review at November 20, 2017.

It makes possible to prevent the occurrence of electrostatic discharges. The growing complexity of the structure and the electronic component base of the spacecraft lead to increase concerns about its existence in the space environment. Over the past two decades, numerous conferences have been held as well as books are published on issues related to plasma interactions the same as areas of spacecraft surface charging. Nevertheless, the effects of differential charging with a subsequent discharge are still the main source of cosmic anomalies.

The main disadvantage of such systems consist in the fact that measurements can be actually carried out only when the drilling operation is stopped. In this paper, a dedicated X-band equipment for LWD telemetry along pipes regarded as dielectric waveguides is proposed. A hybrid-integrated power amplifier-transmitter for this purpose is described. This system represents a modern solution to geophysical applications where transitions from vertical to horizontal drilling are required. Drilling pipes provide a new communication channel for telemetry although the potential issues related to large attenuation in the soil and external disturbances are to be carefully assessed beforehand. In particular, great attention has to be put in such a way as to achieve an efficient excitation and reduced distortion of the radio signal propagating along the pipe. In the paper we put in details the simulated performances, transmitter design, and current-efficiently issues. The output power is up to 10-25 Wt in short-pulse mode, at central lobe of 9-10 GHz. This level of power is sufficient for the short boreholes. The proposed amplifier-transmitter is used to establish a new communication channel. It is link between surface and the drilling point. Some review explaining the great degree of interest in this topic is presented. Experimental measurement results are provided as well. © 2018 IEEE.","borehole waveguide; logging-while-drilling; LWD; microwave pulse generator; power transmitter","Boreholes; Boring; Communication channels (information theory); Drilling equipment; Electromagnetic logging; Horizontal drilling; Infill drilling; Power amplifiers; Telemetering equipment; Transmitters; Waveguides; Advanced signal processing; Electromagnetic channels; Geophysical applications; Integrated power amplifiers; Logging while drilling; Microwave pulse; Power transmitters; Simulated performance; Signal processing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Prensky, S., Recent advantages in LWD/MWD and formation evaluation (2006) World Oil, pp. 69-75. , March; Liu, X., Cheng, G., The research of information and power transmission property for intelligent drillstring 2010 Second International Conference on Information Technology and Computer Science, , IEEE 978-0-7695-4074-0/10; Kochumeev, V.A., Mirmanov, A.B., Pushkarev, V.P., Stukach, O.V., Problems in design of the new microwave geophysical measuring system MIKON-2012, 19-th International Conference on Microwave Radar and Wireless Communications, 2, pp. 516-518. , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6233570/, 21-23 May; Qu, S., Zhu, K., Nie, Z., Sun, X., Yang, P., Analysis of signal transmission for use of logging while drilling (2013) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 10 (5), pp. 1001-1005. , September; Goponenko, A.S., Stukach, O.V., Mirmanov, A.B., Kochumeev, V.A., 15 watt high efficiency gunn diode transmitter for measurement-while-drilling wireless system IWSSIP-International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing, pp. 243-246. , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6837676/, 12-15 May 2014.

The detection method is based on defining the spatial orientation of radiating circuit, as well as on measuring its resonance frequency. Orientation of components of electromagnetic field of transmitter and receiver electric antennas, as well as orientation of components of radiating circuit field have been studied to achieve the purpose. The condition of having the maximal level of contact noises to be radiated by the circuit which is essential for its reliable detection was defined. In order to define equivalent size of radiating circuit a dependence of its resonance frequency as an electric oscillating system from circuit size, material of which components which form radiating circuit are made, from wireless signal carrier frequency has been established. During research the skin effect of current density distribution over the thickness of conducting elements of radiating circuit has been taken into account. The method requires no application of sophisticated apparatus and may be applied in the field. Radio stations installed in vehicles may be used as technical means of radiating circuit detection. © 2018 IEEE.","Antennas; Contact noises to radio reception; Electromagnetic compatibility; Wireless communication in motion","Antennas; Electromagnetic compatibility; Electromagnetic fields; Natural frequencies; Radio stations; Wireless telecommunication systems; Current density distribution; Oscillating systems; Radio reception; Reliable detection; Resonance frequencies; Spatial orientations; Transmitter and receiver; Wireless communications; Oscillators (electronic)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Klementenko, A.Y., Panov, B.A., Sveshnikov, V.F., (1979) Contact Disturbed, pp. 16-48. , Moscow, Russia, Military Publishing; Fedorov, N.N., (1980) Fundamentals of Electrodynamics, pp. 264-266. , Moscow, Russia, Vysshaya shkola; Goldshtein, L.D., Zernov, N.V., (1971) Electromagnetic Fields and Waves, pp. 288-305. , Moscow, Russia, Sovetskoe radio; Meinke, H., Gundlach, F.W., (1961) Radiotechnical Reference Manual., 1, pp. 322-325. , Moscow, Russia, State powerengineering publishing house; Neuman, L.R., Demirchyan, K.S., (1981) Theoretical Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering., 2, pp. 317-320. , Leningrad, Russia, Energoizdat; Iossel, Ya., Kochanov, E.S., Strunskiy, M.G., Calculation of electrical capacitance (1981) Leningrad, Russia, Energoizdat, pp. 86-88",,,"IEEE Russia Central Section;National Instruments R and D;National Research University ""Higher School of Economics"";Russian Foundation for Basic Research","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1st Moscow Workshop on Electronic and Networking Technologies, MWENT 2018","14 March 2018 through 16 March 2018",,135880,,9781538634974,,,"English","Mosc.

The setup allows to implement the method of high-field tunnel injection of charge carriers under the stress and measurement modes. For the method the main injection of charge into gate dielectric is realized under stress modes at which either voltage, applied to the gate, or current, flowing through the dielectric, is held constant. In order to obtain additional information about changing of charge state of MIS structure one should analyze not only time dependencies of currents and voltages during the stress conditions but, besides, a change of current-voltage characteristics of MIS structure which are acquired before and after injection at measurement level of currents and voltages that are significantly lower than stress levels. As a result, charge effects, which can be observed in MIS structure at the time of stress mode setting, become available to be researched. Besides, that makes possible to take into account an influence of the charge effects to a change of the charge state of gate dielectric under high-field injection of charge carriers. © 2018 IEEE.","charge state; gate dielectric; high-field tunnel injection; MIS structures; setup","Charge carriers; Current voltage characteristics; Dielectric films; Charge state; Currents and voltages; Measurement conditions; MIS structure; National Instruments; setup; Thin dielectric film; Tunnel injection; Gate dielectrics",,,,,"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka; Bauman Moscow State Technical University, Bauman MSTU: 8.6779.2017","This study was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, state task of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University (project No. 8.6779.2017).",,,,,,,,,,"Strong, A., Wu, E., Vollertsen, R., Sune, J., Rosa, G., Rauch, S., Sullivan, T., (2009) Reliability Wearout Mechanisms in Advanced CMOS Technologies, , Hoboken, NJ, USA: Wiley-IEEE Press; (2001) Procedure for the Wafer-Level Testing of Thin Dielectrics, , JEDEC standard JESD35-A; Andreev, V.V., Bondarenko, G.G., Maslovsky, V.M., Stolyarov, A.A., Multilevel current stress technique for investigation thin oxide layers of MOS structures (2012) IOP Conf.

The compression method is based on the analysis of the frequency distribution of the incoming data stream, the selection of the constant by sorting and, on the basis of this, subsequent compression. The combination of sorting and data compression proposed in the article allows saving processing time and dynamically manage the network controller load. The hardware algorithm implementation on FPGA for sorting and compressing data during stream processing of information is considered. The solution makes it possible to implement an algorithm in the form of an IP core, with the ability to adapt it to the characteristics of solving its task of compressing data, thereby increasing system performance. This algorithm can be used to create embedded applications with limited computing resources and time-critical requirements. The device, based on the method considered, showed stable operation in the task of processing data from a multichannel system of high-speed sensors. This algorithm can be applied in solving problems of creation the telecommunications networks of distributed control systems, data processing subsystems Internet of Things and Internet of Robotic Things. © 2018 IEEE.","distributed control system; FPGA; lossless compression; sorting of data; telecommunication system","Computer hardware description languages; Distributed parameter control systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Information management; Sorting; Telecommunication systems; Compression methods; Data lossless compression; Embedded application; Frequency distributions; Hardware algorithm; Lossless compression; Multichannel system; Telecommunications networks; Data compression",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Komarov, V., Antonichev, G., Kim, L., Kokovin, V., Krotov, N., Kuznetsov, V., Milichenko, Yu., Voevodin, V., Modernization of U-70 general timing system (2005) Proceedings of ICALEPCS-2005, , Geneva, Switzerland, October 10-14; Sutikno, Jidin, A., Basar, M.F., Simple realization of 5-segment discontinuous svpwm based on FPGA (2010) International Journal of Computer and Electrical Engineering, 2 (1). , Feb; Ray, P.P., Internet of robotic things: Concept, technologies, and challenges (2016) IEEEAccess, 4, pp. 9489-9500; Marcelino, R., Neto, H., Cardoso, J., Sorting units for FPGA-based embedded systems. in distributed embedded systems: Design (2008) Middleware and Resources, Volume 271 of IFIP International Federation for Information Processing, pp. 11-22. , Springer Boston; Ouyang, J., Luo, H., Wang, Z., Tian, J., Liu, C., Sheng, K., FPGA implementation of gzip compression and decompression for idc services (2010) Field-Programmable Technology (FPT), 2010 International Conference On.

Usage of a quadratic cost function allows to develop a control with coefficients that include the solution of the Riccati equation. A rather common approach is to solve this equation online which requires making high performance calculations that is not appropriate for some applications such as UAV autopilots. The method represented in this article is useful when the system state space is compact and the performance or weight of a control device is more critical than memory size. Thus, we can sample state space with some accuracy. It is offered to calculate regulator gain coefficients in advance and to keep them in memory of the control device. Assessment of the regulator gain coefficients quantity and memory size depending on accuracy of system state space sampling is provided. The algorithm of the next gain coefficient fast search is given. The numerical simulation of a UAV controlled by such a regulator is made for verification. © 2018 IEEE.","nonlinear dynamic systems; quaternion algebra; Riccati equation; state dependent coefficients","Dynamical systems; Dynamics; Equations of state; Microcontrollers; Nonlinear dynamical systems; Nonlinear equations; Riccati equations; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Control device; Gain coefficients; High-performance calculations; Nonlinear state; Quadratic cost functions; Quaternion algebra; State dependent coefficients; System state; Cost functions",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 17-11-01220","This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (Project No. 17-11-01220).",,,,,,,,,,"Pearson, J.D., Approximation methods in optimal control (1962) Journal of Electronics and Control, 13 (1), pp. 453-469. , May; Mracek, C.P., Cloutier, J.R., Full envelope missile longitudinal autopilot design, using the state-dependent Riccati equation method (1997) Proc. the AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference, pp. 1697-1705. , New Orleans, USA; Afanasiev, V.N., Semion, A.A., Controller with discrete variable parameters (2014) Control Sciences, (5), pp. 14-19. , May; Bogdanov, A., Carlson, M., Harvey, G., Hunt, J., Kieburtz, D., Merwe, R., Wan, E., State-dependent Riccati equation control of a small unmanned helicopter (2003) Proc.

At the controlled attenuator design it is necessary to reveal the factor loadings separately influencing to phase variation and insertion loss.

This mode is characterized by the high-field Fowler-Nordheim injection. We have shown that ionization processes occurring in dielectric films of MIS structures, which are in the mode of charging and discharging of capacitance and also in the mode of high-field tunnel injection of electrons by pulse of constant current, could be used in order to register the irradiation.

The symmetrical multivibrator was taken as an example of typical digital device and the computer simulations were performed using the LTspice software. Nanoconductive dielectrics have less electrificability, thus provide fewer electrostatic discharges (ESD) caused by the action of electron irradiation. Based on the results of computer simulations and calculations the dielectric parameters of the printed circuit board for which ESD are physically impossible were determined. It was shown that the change in the output parameters of the multivibrator does not exceed 5%. Therefore, it is possible and necessary to use nanoconductive dielectrics in the on-board radio electronic systems and equipment of space vehicles. According to our data, such dielectrics discharge-free, also conductivity raised to 10-9 Ω-Ω-1 does not affect the operation of the electronics. © 2018 IEEE.","computer simulation; Concept of the nanoconductivity of insulators; discharge-free space vehicles; electrostatic discharge; internal electrification; replacing high-resistivity insulatorswith the nanoconducting dielectrics","Automobile electronic equipment; Computer simulation; Dielectric materials; Digital devices; Electron irradiation; Electrostatic discharge; Electrostatics; Laser optics; Multivibrators; Printed circuit boards; Vibrators; Concept of possibility; Dielectric parameters; Electro-Static Discharge (ESD); Free spaces; High resistivity; internal electrification; Radio electronics; Spacecraft electronics; Electrostatic devices",,,,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics, ВШЭ","The author would like to thank the Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics for their support.",,,,,,,,,,"Frederickson, A.R., Cotts, D.B., Wall, J.A., Bouquet, F.L., Spacecraft dielectric material properties and spacecraft charging (1986) AIAA Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics, 107, pp. 95-100; Babkin, G.V., Vakhnichenko, V.V., Ivanov, V.A., Levitsky, Y.E., Lukyashchenko, V.I., Morozov, M., Antistatic protection of native spacecraft. the state of the problem and the prospect of its solution (2003) Cosmonautics and Rocket Science, 1 (30), pp. 5-14; Ivanov, V.A., Morozov, E.P., Internal electrification of dielectric elements of electro-radio products is an cunning factor of impact of space environment on the on-board equipment (2012) Cosmonautics and Rocket Science, 1 (66), pp. 129-141; Abrameshin, A.E., (2016) Methodology of Designing On-board Radio-electronic Equipment of Space Vehicles Taking into Account the Impact of the Damaging Factors of Electrification; Frederickson, A.R., Upsets related to spacecraftcharging (1996) IEEE Trans.Nucl.

However very few have compared their results and experiences in a systematic way. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a first step to develop a comparative framework of OGD.

Some important features of these packages were contrary to neo-classical prescriptions, since the ""shock therapists"" operated in unprecedented setting of imploding ""command economy"". This setting as such never was a subject of neo-liberal theoreticians before it became empirical reality. Marxist-Leninist single party-state regimes are prone to macroeconomic implosion, since the socio-economic actors they create during forced ""transition to market"" prefer neither ""plan"" nor ""market"", but a grey ""no-man's land"" between the two. This position allows them to ""privatize the profits"" and to ""nationalize the costs"", contributing to accumulation of tremendous macroeconomic imbalances on the aggregate systemic level. It also creates socio-economic, political and institutional impasse of financial deleveraging, which may eventually turn into a forced ""big-bang"" package amidst systemic implosion. Chinese ""gradual transition"" - with all singularities - still fits quite well into this dynamic empirical pattern. Sharp decline in the Chinese growth rate since spring 2013 was a man-made phenomenon. The leadership intends to deregulate interest rates and upgrade financial discipline of scared investors, making them to withdraw money from the state and non-state assets. The overall systemic setting increases the chances of financial deleveraging in China to turn eventually into a forced ""bigbang"" upheaval. © 2018 Institute of China and Asia-Pacific Studies - National Sun Yat-sen University.All Rights Reserved.","China; Economic models; Russia; Shock therapy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aslund, A., (1995) How Russia became a market economy, , Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press; Aven, P., Koch, A., (2015) Gaidar's revolution: The history of the 1990s reforms from the first hands, , Moscow: Alpina Publishers; Chang, G., (2001) The coming collapse of China, , New York: Random House; Csanadi, M., (2006) Self-consuming evolutions, , Budapest: Akademiai Kiado; Gang, F., (1996) Jianjin gaige de zhengzhijingjixue fenxi, , The analysis of political economy of the gradual reform Shanghai: Yuandong Press; Friedrich, C.J., Brzezinski, Z.K., (1956) Totalitarian dictatorship and autocracy, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Gaidar, Y., (2012) The fall of the empire: Lessons for today's Russia, , Moscow: Astrel Publishers.

We investigate codimension q ≥ 2 Weyl foliations on (not necessarily compact) manifolds. Different interpretations of their holonomy groups are given. We prove a criterion for a Weyl foliation to be pseudo-Riemannian. We find a condition on the holonomy groups which guarantees the existence of a transitive attractor of (M, F ). Moreover, if the Weyl foliation is complete, this condition implies the existence of a global transitive attractor.

This phenomenon is known to occur in the evolution of magnetic fields of astrophysical bodies. In the 1970s A.D. Sakharov and Ya.B. Zeldovich proposed a ""rope"" scheme of this process which in terms of the modern theory of dynamical systems can be described as Smale solenoid. The main disadvantage of this scheme is that it is non-conservative. Our model is a modification of the Sakharov-Zeldovich's model. We apply methods of the theory of dynamical systems to prove that it is free of this fault in the neighborhood of the nonwandering set. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Dynamical systems; Interactive devices; Kinematics; Conducting medium; Exponential growth; Kinematic dynamo; Nonwandering set; Electromagnetic field effects",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 17-11-01041","This work is supported by the Russian Science Foundation under grant 17-11-01041, except for the proof of Lemma 2 (the extention of the diffeomorphism to a conservative diffeomorphism).

We discuss two approaches to getting extreme value approximations for every function of the system and for every box of the covering. One approach is based on the idea that the system should be simplified to get rid of multiple occurrences of an interval in an inequality. Another one is the straightforward approach without system manipulations that is used the initial system and the interval analysis to get the extreme approximations. We juxtapose the results to find the difference between the approaches based on the number of iterations needed to get the approximation. The results show that the approach with system simplification gives better approximations and uses less iterations to get the solution. © 2018 IEEE.","dependency problem; interval analysis; Nonuniform covering","Industrial engineering; dependency problem; Extreme value; Interval analysis; Nonlinear inequality; Nonuniform covering; Number of iterations; Solution set; Engineering",,,,,"16-19-00148","*The work was supported by the Russian Science Fund, project 16-19-00148.",,,,,,,,,,"Evtushenko, Y., Posypkin, M., Rybak, L., Turkin, A., Approximating a solution set of nonlinear inequalities (2017) Journal of Global Optimization, pp. 1-17; Evtushenko, Y.G., Numerical methods for finding global extrema (case of a non-uniform mesh) (1971) USSR Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics, 11 (6), pp. 38-54; Evtushenko, Y.G., Posypkin, M.A., Nonuniform covering method as applied to multicriteria optimization problems with guaranteed accuracy (2013) Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics, 53 (2), pp. 144-157; Jaulin, L., Walter, E., Set inversion via interval analysis for nonlinear bounded-error estimation (1993) Automatica, 29 (4), pp. 1053-1064; Jaulin, L., (2001) Applied Interval Analysis: With Examples in Parameter and State Estimation, Robust Control and Robotics, 1. , Springer Science & Business Media; Hansen, E., Walster, G.W., (2003) Global Optimization Using Interval Analysis: Revised and Expanded, 264. , CRC Press; Solovyev, A., Hales, T.C., Formal verification of nonlinear inequalities with taylor interval approximations (2013) NASA Formal Methods Symposium, pp. 383-397. , Springer",,"Shaposhnikov S.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 IEEE Conference of Russian Young Researchers in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, ElConRus 2018","29 January 2018 through 1 February 2018",,135266,,9781538643396,,,"English","Proc.

Artema, Donetsk, 83001, Ukraine","Dynamics of longitudinal impact in rods of variable cross-section is considered. Rods of various configurations are used as elements of power pulse systems. There is no single method to the construction of a mathematical model of longitudinal impact on rods. The creation of a general method for constructing a mathematical model of longitudinal impact for rods of variable cross-section is the goal of the article. An elastic rod is considered with a cross-sectional area varying in powers of law from the longitudinal coordinate. The solution of the wave equation is obtained using the Fourier method. Special functions are introduced on the basis of recurrence relations for Bessel functions for solving boundary value problems. The expression for the square of the norm is obtained taking into account the orthogonality property of the eigen functions with weight. For example, the impact of an inelastic mass along the wide end of a conical rod is considered. The expressions for the displacements, forces and stresses of the rod sections are obtained for the cases of sudden velocity communication and the application of force. The proposed mathematical model makes it possible to carry out investigations of the stress-strain state in rods of variable and constant cross-section for various conditions of dynamic effects. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Condensed matter physics; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Materials science; Cross sectional area; Dynamic effects; Fourier methods; Orthogonality properties; Recurrence relations; Special functions; Stress strain state; Variable cross section; Boundary value problems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gulyaev, V., Lugovoi, P., Borshch, E., (2013) Int.

We discuss physical mechanisms of magnetoelectric coupling considering domain walls and spin cycloids. We review the progress on multiferroic materials focusing on high temperature multiferroic: rare earth iron garnet and bismuth ferrite. We argue that topological structures play a pivotal role in multiferoics and show that electric control of magnetism can be carried out via spin spirals and domain walls. Magnetic domain walls produce ferroelectricity in rare earth iron garnets; transformations of spin cycloids release magnetoelectricity in bismuth ferrite. Ferroic orders couple via magnetic inhomogeneities, which shed new light on fundamental physics and applications. © 2018 Polish Academy of Sciences.

The optical lattice potential manifests itself in an interplay between an increase in the density of states on the Fermi surface and the modification of the fermion-fermion interaction (scattering) amplitude. The density of states is enhanced due to an increase of the effective mass of atoms. In deep lattices, for short-range interacting atoms the scattering amplitude is strongly reduced compared to free space due to a small overlap of wavefunctions of fermions sitting in the neighboring lattice sites, which suppresses the p-wave superfluidity. However, we show that for a moderate lattice depth there is still a possibility to create atomic p-wave superfluids with sizable transition temperatures. The situation is drastically different for fermionic polar molecules. Being dressed with a microwave field, they acquire a dipole-dipole attractive tail in the interaction potential. Then, due to a long-range character of the dipole-dipole interaction, the effect of the suppression of the scattering amplitude in 2D lattices is absent. This leads to the emergence of a stable topological px + ipy superfluid of identical microwave-dressed polar molecules. © 2018 Author(s).",,,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 341197; European Research Council, ERC; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 17-08-00742; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; Nanjing University of Science and Technology, NUST","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013 Grant Agreement no. 341197).

Three force-field models are tested: the TraPPE-UA united-atom forcefield, LOPLS-AA all-atom forcefield and a fully flexible version of the TraPPE-EH all-atom forcefield. All those forcefields reproduce well the composition of liquid phase in the mixture as a function of pressure at the 300 K isotherm, while significant discrepancies from experimental data are observed in the saturated vapor compositions with OPLS-AA and TraPPE-UA forcefields. The best agreement with the experimental phase diagram is found with TraPPE-EH forcefield which accurately reproduces compositions of both liquid and vapor phase.

However, the proper microscopic models of the interaction between ultrashort laser pulses and metal NPs are currently not very well developed in many cases. One part of the problem is the description of the warm dense matter that is formed in NPs after intense irradiation. Another part of the problem is the description of the electromagnetic waves around NPs. Description of wave propagation requires the solution of Maxwell's equations and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is the classic approach for solving them. There are many commercial and free implementations of FDTD, including the open source software that supports graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration. In this report we present the results on the FDTD calculations for different cases of the interaction between ultrashort laser pulses and metal nanoparticles. Following our previous results, we analyze the efficiency of the GPU acceleration of the FDTD algorithm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Electromagnetic waves; Finite difference time domain method; Laser pulses; Maxwell equations; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Nanoparticles; Open source software; Open systems; Program processors; Software engineering; Time domain analysis; Ultrashort pulses; Wave propagation; FDTD algorithm; FDTD calculations; Finite difference time domain simulations; GPU accelerations; Graphics Processing Unit (GPU); Microscopic models; Modern technologies; Warm dense matters; Graphics processing unit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Terakawa, M., Nedyalkov, N., (2016) Adv.

The main attention is paid to the high altitudes over the lunar surface including the range of the altitudes between 30 and 110 km where the measurements of dust were performed within the NASA LADEE mission. From the viewpoint of the formation of dust cloud at high altitudes over the Moon, the most important zone formed by the meteoroid impact is the zone of melting of substance. Only the droplets originated from this zone have the speeds between the first and second astronautical velocities (for the Moon). Correspondingly, only such droplets can perform finite movement around the Moon. The liquid droplets harden when rising over the lunar surface. Furthermore, they aquire electric charges due to the action, in particular, of the solar wind electrons and ions, as well as of the solar radiation. Thus dusty plasmas exist in the lunar exosphere with the characteristic number density ≲ 10-2 m-3 of dust particles with the sizes from 300 nm to 1 μm which is in accordance with the results of measurements performed by LADEE. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Drops; Dust; Ionosphere; Meteor impacts; NASA; Plasma diagnostics; Plasma theory; Semiconductor plasmas; Dust particle; Dusty plasmas; Liquid droplets; Lunar exospheres; Lunar surface; Measurements of; Meteoroid impacts; Number density; Moon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stubbs, T.J., Vondrak, R.R., Farrell, W.M., (2006) Adv.

Deviations from this dependence (up to the increase at cryogenic temperatures) found in the experimental results for the pressures range 0.1-8.0 mbar and for the currents range 0.1-1.0 mA are given. Inter-particle distance dependences on the charge of particles, parameter of the trap and the screening length in surrounding plasma are obtained for different conditions from molecular dynamics simulations. They are well approximated by power functions in the mentioned range of parameters. It is found that under certain assumptions thermophoretical force is responsible for inter-particle distance increase at cryogenic temperatures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cryogenics; Dust; Molecular dynamics; Semiconductor plasmas; Cryogenic temperatures; Dusty plasma crystals; Dusty plasmas; Interparticle distances; Molecular dynamics simulations; Neutral gas temperatures; Power functions; Screening lengths; Plasma theory",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fortov, V.E., Morfill, G.E., (2010) Complex and Dusty Plasmas: From Laboratory to Space, , (Boca Raton: CRC Press); Martynova, I.A., Iosilevsky, I.L., (2016) J.

The embedded atom method potential is used at the simulation. The stress correlation behavior is studied in the plane of the film and along the direction normal to the plane. The behavior of the kinematic viscosity and the stress correlations are compared for cooling and heating process. Using two methods we showed that the glass transition for the cooling process is higher than for the heating. The first method is based on the stress correlations in the plane of the film and the steep change of the kinematic viscosity. The second method is based on the transverse oscillations in the film. The glass transition temperature is estimated from the dependence of the oscillation damping on temperature. The increasing in the kinematic viscosity correlates with the decrease of transverse oscillations damping in the film. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aluminum; Cooling; Damping; Glass; Kinematics; Liquid metals; Molecular dynamics; Temperature; Viscosity of liquids; Cooling process; Embedded-atom method potentials; Heating process; Liquid aluminum; Oscillation damping; Transverse oscillation; Viscosity behavior; Glass transition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kolotova, L.N., Norman, G.E., Pisarev, V.V., (2015) J.

The method is based on the use of a spark discharge generator as a source of dry nanoparticles and a heating plate for their sintering. This method allows creating conductive silver lines on a heated silicon substrate up to 300 °C without an additional sintering step. It was found that for effective sintering lines of silver nanoparticles the temperature of the heated substrate should be about more than 200-250 °C. Average thickness of the sintered silver lines was equal to ∼20 μm. Printed lines showed electrical resistivity equal to 35 μΩ•cm, which is 23 times greater than the resistivity of bulk silver. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aerosols; Composite materials; Fighter aircraft; Nanoparticles; Silver nanoparticles; Sintering; Substrates; Aerosol jet printings; Conductive lines; Heated substrates; Heating plates; Silicon substrates; Spark discharge; Silver",,,,,"Council on grants of the President of the Russian Federation","This work was supported by the grant of the President of Russian Federation for young scientists MK-2302.2017.8 and carried out using the equipment of the Center for the collective use of high-precision measuring technologies in the field of photonics (ckp.vniiofi.ru).",,,,,,,,,,"He, Y., Oakley, C., Chahal, P., Albrecht, J., Papapolymerou, J., Aerosol Jet printed 24 GHz end-fire quasi-Yagi-Uda antenna on a 3-D printed cavity substrate 2017 International Workshop on Antenna Technology: Small Antennas, Innovative Structures, and Applications (iWAT) (2017) 2017 International Workshop on Antenna Technology: Small Antennas, Innovative Structures, and Applications (IWAT), pp. 179-182; Cho, J.H., Lee, J., Xia, Y., Kim, B., He, Y., Renn, M.J., Lodge, T.P., Daniel Frisbie, C., Printable ion-gel gate dielectrics for low-voltage polymer thin-film transistors on plastic (2008) Nat.

This amendment provides various ways to improve the efficiency of Wi-Fi. The most revolutionary one is OFDMA. Apart from obvious advantages, such as decreasing overhead for short packet transmission at high rates and improving robustness to frequency selective interference, being used for uplink transmission, OFDMA can increase power spectral density and, consequently, user data rates. However, the gain of OFDMA mainly depends on the resource scheduling between users. The peculiarities of OFDMA implementation in Wi-Fi completely change properties of classic schedulers used in other OFDMA systems, e.g. LTE. In the paper, we consider the usage of OFDMA in Wi-Fi for uplink transmission. We study peculiarities of OFDMA in Wi-Fi, adapt classic schedulers to Wi-Fi, explaining why they do not perform well. Finally we develop a novel scheduler, MUTAX, and evaluate its performance with simulation. © 2017 IEEE.","High effiency WLAN; IEEE 802.11ax; OFDMA; Scheduling; Wi-Fi","Frequency division multiple access; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio communication; Scheduling; Spectral density; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); 802.11ax; Frequency-selective; High effiency WLAN; High throughput; OFDMA; Resource-scheduling; Up-link transmissions; WiFi standard; IEEE Standards",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 16-19-10687","The research was done at IITP RAS and was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (agreement No 16-19-10687).",,,,,,,,,,"Khorov, E., Kiryanov, A., Lyakhov, A., IEEE 802.11 ax: How to build high efficiency WLANs (2015) 2015 International Conference on Engineering and Telecommunication (EnT), pp. 14-19. , IEEE; Khorov, E., Loginov, V., Lyakhov, A., Several edca parameter sets for improving channel access in ieee 802.11 ax networks (2016) Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS), 2016 International Symposium On, pp. 419-423. , IEEE; Karaca, M., Bastard, S., Priyanto, B.E., Safavi, M., Landfeldt, B., Resource management for OFDMA based next generation 802.11 WLANs (2016) Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC), 2016 9th IFIP, pp. 57-64. , IEEE; Kim, S., Park, H., Kim, J., Ryu, K., Cho, H., (2017) Llax par Verification Through OFDMA, , https://mentor.ieee.org/802.ll/dcn/16/ll-16-1363-01-OOax-11ax-par-verification-through-ofdma.ppt, January; Su, H., Pang, J., Zhu, J., Zhang, J., Ma, C., (2016) Preliminary Llax par Verification, , https://mentor.ieee.org/802.ll/dcn/16/ll-16-1363-01-OOax-11ax-par-verification-through-ofdma.ppt, September; Lanante, L., Ochi, H., Uwai, T., Nagao, Y., Kurosaki, M., Ghosh, C., Performance analysis of the 802.1 lax UL OFDMA random access protocol in dense networks (2017) Communications, 2017, , ICC'17.

It extends Wi-Fi with new functionality supporting high number of autonomous devices with various power capabilities and traffic patterns. In the paper, we study the cooperation of such new mechanisms as TIM Segmentation and Restricted Access Window. TIM Segmentation reduces energy consumption for low-power devices retrieving data from the Access Point, while Restricted Access Window reduces contention and allows the Access Point to protect stations with different capabilities from interfering each other. We consider joint usage of these mechanisms in a heterogeneous network with a high number of low-power stations with rare traffic and several powered stations with saturated traffic. Specifically, for TIM Segmentation and Restricted Access Window we develop a simple and fairly accurate mathematical method to set up the parameters of the mechanisms in order to improve performance for both types of stations, i.e. to reduce power consumption for low-power stations and to increase throughput for the other ones. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Energy utilization; Heterogeneous networks; Radio communication; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Autonomous devices; Improve performance; Improving efficiency; Internet of things technologies; Low-power devices; Mathematical method; Power capability; Traffic pattern; Low power electronics",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 15-07-09350 a.","The study was partially supported by RFBR, project No. 15-07-09350 a.",,,,,,,,,,"Khorov, E., Lyakhov, A., Krotov, A., Guschin, A., A survey on IEEE 802.11ah: An enabling networking technology for smart cities (2015) Computer Communications, 58, pp. 53-69; Bianchi, G., Performance analysis of the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (2000) Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal On, 18 (3), pp. 535-547; Raessi, O., Pirskanen, J., Nazmi, A., Levanen, T., Valkama, M., Performance evaluation of IEEE 802.11ah and its restricted access window mechanism (2014) IEEE ICC 2014, pp. 460-466. , IEEE; Bel, A., Adame, T., Bellalta, B., An energy consumption model for IEEE 802.11ah WLANs (2015) CoRR, Abs/1512.03576; Khorov, E., Krotov, A., Lyakhov, A., Modelling machine type communication in IEEE 802.11ah networks (2015) IEEE ICC 2015, pp. 1149-1154. , IEEE; Bankov, D., Khorov, E., Kureev, A., Lyakhov, A., Improving efficiency of heterogeneous wi-fi networks with energy-limited devices (2016) Lecture Notes on Computer Science, 9870, pp. 181-192",,,"IEEE;IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc);Perswade","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","28th Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, PIMRC 2017","8 October 2017 through 13 October 2017",,134680,,9781538635315,,,"English","IEEE Int Symp Person Indoor Mobile Radio Commun PIMRC",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045249321

Discrete approach is advisable in solving these problems [2]. Justification of the applied mathematical model for the discrete interaction follows from the difference form of electrodynamic theory of excitation [3]. Requirements to coefficients of the resulting finite-difference equation are high, because their accuracy determines how close the mathematical model of the discrete interaction to the physical laws is. These coefficients have a certain electrodynamic sense and are obtained through the octopole transmission matrix coefficients.

The CW has period of 433 days, average amplitude of 0.13 milliarcseconds (mas) which is changing, and phase jump by φ in 1930-th. The CW amplitude strongly (almost to zero) decreases in 1930-th and 2010-th with the phase jump in 1930th. The envelope model contains 83- and 42-years quasi-periodicities. We think the first one can be represented by the 166-years changes of the envelope, crossing zero in 1930th. We reconstruct Chandler input excitation based on the Euler-Liouville equation. Its amplitude has ∼ 20-years variations. We explain this based on simple model and prove, that they appear in consequence of 42-years modulation of CW. The excitation amplifies the amplitude of CW for ∼ 20 years then damps it for another ∼ 20 years. The analysis of the modulated CW signal in a sliding window demonstrates the specific effect, we called the ""escargot effect"", when instantaneous ""virtual"" retrograde component appears in the purely prograde (at long-time interval) signal. Chandler excitation envelope shape is similar to this instantaneous retrograde component, which reflects the changes of ellipticity of the approximation ellipse. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Physics; Chandler wobbles; Envelope models; Phase jumps; Quasi-periodicities; Simple modeling; Sliding Window; Specific effects; Time interval; Beryllium compounds",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 16-05-00753","This work is supported by the Chinese “111 Plan”, NRU HSE support, RFBR grant No 16-05-00753, and monthly position at Paris observatory for the first author.",,,,,,,,,,"Bizouard, C., Remus, F., Lambert, S.B., Seoane, L., Gambis, D., The Earth's variable Chandler wobble (2011) Astronomy & Astrophysics, 526, p.

Purpose of this work is to identify these indicators and to analyze how the state can affect these figures with available instruments. Here was constructed a model where the targets can be calculated from raw data - tools in the field of economic policy. Software code that implements all relations among the indicators and allows to analyze with high accuracy, sufficiently successful economic policies and with the help of some tools, you can achieve better results. This model can be used to forecast macroeconomic scenarios. The corresponding values of the objective (outcome) variables are set as a consequence of the configuration data of the previous period, subject to external influences and depend on the instrumental variables. The results may be useful in economical predictions. The results were successfully checked on real scenarios of Russian, European and Chinese economics. Moreover, the results can be applied in the field of education. Program is available to use as ""economical game"" the educational process of the University, in which you can virtually implement various macroeconomic scenarios, draw conclusions about their success. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Planning; Configuration datum; Economic policies; Economic situation; Educational process; External influences; Instrumental variables; Macroeconomic indicators; Simulation systems; Beryllium compounds",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vnukov, A.A., Raevsky, S.N., Program for creating and editing business game parameters (2011) Computer Programs.

The field of application may be the interdisciplinary studies of many social phenomena. The reason is that they have a stochastic nature. The aim of the paper is to display the opportunities of using the methods of natural sciences in the social sciences. The example is suggested of the research of ethnically mixed families. These are the marital couples where a husband and a wife consider themselves as belonging to different ethnicities. It was demonstrated that application of the reasons used in the kinetic theory helps us to introduce new measure that describes mutual attitudes for a specific combination of ethnicities. The idea of this measure calculation is quite simple. We directly relate the number of marriages established from the reasons of full randomness of collisions of ""particles"" (persons) and their connection irrespective to their type, and the phenomenology - the actual number of families for a given combination of husband's and wife's ethnicity observed form the population censuses. What we mean by ""collision"" is any form of personal or social interaction. This measure may be called inter-ethnic propensity, or its inverse value as a mutual inter-ethnic distance. It was shown that in such multiethnic country like Russia both measures cannot be estimated as the good ones. However this does not mean that the measures introduced are the wrong ones in principle. Simply before their calculation we require to perform co-called ""geographical"" decomposition that explicitly takes into account the fact and the extent of territorial distribution of population of all the ethnicities in this country by regions. In terms of kinetic approach for gases it may have the analogy of various density of different particles by the volume they are placed in, that is required at consideration of their physical properties. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Beryllium compounds; Economic and social effects; Geographical regions; Statistical Physics; Stochastic systems; Inter-disciplinary studies; Kinetic approach; Mathematical method; Population census; Social interactions; Stochastic nature; Various densities; Density of gases",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Orlov Yu, N., Suslin, V.M., Kinetic equations for some demographic models (2003) Math.

Analytical solutions of a steady forced buoyant jet of the atmospheric convective boundary layer and a spontaneous jet of a surface layer are presented.

Generation time is linear in the number of edges.

They change, among other reasons, due to difficulties of implementation, bug repairs, and environmental shifts. Thus, their behavior differs from models, which were used at the design stage. Process owner usually wants relevant, up-to-date models. Fortunately, most modern information systems write detailed event logs of their functioning. In this paper, we describe an algorithm of non-local process correction, that employs the two fundamental algorithmic paradigms: 'divide and conquer' and 'greedy processing'. It decomposes the process model and repairs sub-models in a greedy way using event logs with actual behavior. Using this procedure, it is possible to correct both local and non-local inconsistencies. The paper considers the algorithm and the results of its experimental evaluation using several artificial examples. © 2017 IEEE.","event logs; process mining; process model correction; process model repair; WF-nets","Divide and conquer; Environmental shifts; Event logs; Experimental evaluation; Process mining; Process Modeling; Software systems; WF-nets",,,,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics, HES","*This work is supported by the Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics.",,,,,,,,,,"Van Der Aalst, W.M.P., (2016) Process Mining-Data Science in Action, , Second Edition.

Main challenges lie in a rich diversity of graph domains emerging in various research areas and the uncertainty about graph properties to be reproduced. Our central statement is that a good graph generation model should follow two requirements on generated graphs: 1) similarity to the original one in terms of manifold graph metrics, and 2) variability wide enough to mimic natural diversity across a graph domain. In this work we have compared three state-of-the-art graph generators, Embedding based Random Graph Generator, Gscaler, and Stochastic Kronecker Graph, universal enough to fit an arbitrary graph. We found that ERGG and Gscaler greatly outperform SKG in graph reproducing accuracy in terms of graph metrics. An experiment with domain imitation showed that the variability of ERGG generated graphs resembled the original variability, while Gscaler graphs were almost identical. © 2017 IEEE.","Evaluation; Graph metric; Random graph generator","Graph theory; Stochastic systems; Comparative studies; Data anonymization; Evaluation; Graph generation; Graph metric; Network structures; Random graphs; Significance testing; Graphic methods",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 17-07-00978","The reported study was funded by RFBR according to the research project 17-07-00978",,,,,,,,,,"Backstrom, L., Dwork, C., Kleinberg, J., Wherefore art thou r3579x?: Anonymized social networks, hidden patterns, and structural steganography (2007) Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web, pp. 181-190. , ACM; Ying, X., Wu, X., Graph generation with prescribed feature constraints (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining.

Under realistic assumptions we provide simple yet non-trivial analytical formulae for the major spectroscopic signals such as the CPT resonance line and the in-phase/quadrature responses. We discuss the influence of the light shift and, in particular, derive a simple expression for the displacement of the resonance as a function of modulation index. The performance of the model is checked against numerical simulations, the agreement is good to perfect. The obtained results can be used in more general models accounting for light absorption in the thick optical medium. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Charge trapping; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Frequency standards; Light absorption; Modulation; Molecular spectroscopy; Analytical formulas; Atomic frequency standards; Coherent population trapping; Frequency modulation spectroscopy; In-phase/quadrature; Modulation techniques; Spectroscopic signals; Theoretical framework; Resonance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shah, V., Kitching, J., (2010) Adv.

The results say that the scores even on different intrinsic benchmarks do not correlate to each other.

Sentences are first automatically translated from a lesser-resourced language to a number of related highly-resourced languages, parsed and then the annotations are projected back to the lesser-resourced language, leading to multiple trees for each sentence from the lesser-resourced language. The final treebank is created by merging the possible trees into a graph and running the spanning tree algorithm to vote for the best tree for each sentence. We present experiments aimed at parsing Faroese using a combination of Danish, Swedish and Norwegian.

In this paper, we transfer this idea to sentence embeddings and explore several approaches to obtain a sparse representation. We further introduce a novel, quantitative and automated evaluation metric for sentence embedding interpretability, based on topic coherence methods. We observe an increase in interpretability compared to dense models, on a dataset of movie dialogs and on the scene descriptions from the MS COCO dataset. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Computational linguistics;

Previously several times settled task has been discussed in the context of the transition to market pricing of wholesale gas volumes and the preservation of state regulation regarding tariffs for the transportation of gas through the Unified Gas Supply System (from now referred to as UGSS). However, to date, the regulation of the domestic gas market, pricing rules and tariffs for transportation have not changed significantly, except for somehow development of the gas exchange trading (SPIMEX), which nevertheless also has some problems and constraints to the development of open market trade. The main criticism in this issue is the currently applied pricing regime, which consists in the presence on the over-the-counter (OTC) market of monopolistically regulated prices and the so-called open pricing mechanism, and exchange prices on the Saint Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange (SPIMEX) gas exchange, respectively. Experts agree that such a system leads to an asymmetry of the market, and, as a consequence, its inefficiency, unequal position of players in the market, as well as risks of a serious shift of the balance towards one player in case of a significant change in gas market regulation. In this regard, each separate proposal of the FAS on reforming the domestic gas market, whether it relates to the division of the dominant seller into production and transportation or the abolition of price regulation, faces severe contradictions on the each player's side. Thus, the pilot project in three subjects of the Russian Federation (Tyumen Region, Yamal-Nenets, and Khanty-Mansiysk Regions) was discussed to be settled in 2016 on the abolition of the lower boundary of the monopolistic regulated gas price for industrial consumers. The project, however, has not been implemented due to the reason mentioned above for the disagreements of all interested parties. Such aspects further exacerbate this problem as the share of the gas industry in exports, and, in particular, the export of liquefied natural gas (from now on LNG). The role of LNG in the transformation of global, regional gas markets has been noted over the past decade by the IEA and Russia, as one of the players in this industry, is also setting strengthening rules the positions of Russian gas companies in LNG markets as one of the country's developments priorities.

We propose a concept of applying monotonic classification models to the analysis process, to make the trained model’s predictions consistent over execution time and provably stable to the injection of any noise or ‘benign-looking’ activity into the program’s behavior. The predictions of such models change monotonically through the log in the sense that the addition of new lines into the log may only increase the probability of the file being found malicious, which make them suitable for real-time classification on a user’s machine. We evaluate monotonic neural network models based on the work by Chistyakov et al. (2017) and demonstrate that they provide stable and interpretable results. © 6th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2018 - Workshop Track Proceedings.

Numerous works show that depth is the key to this efficiency. A certain class of deep convolutional networks – namely those that correspond to the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor decomposition – has been proven to have exponentially higher expressive power than shallow networks. I.e. a shallow network of exponential width is required to realize the same score function as computed by the deep architecture. In this paper, we prove the expressive power theorem (an exponential lower bound on the width of the equivalent shallow network) for a class of recurrent neural networks – ones that correspond to the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. This means that even processing an image patch by patch with an RNN can be exponentially more efficient than a (shallow) convolutional network with one hidden layer. Using theoretical results on the relation between the tensor decompositions we compare expressive powers of the HT- and TT-Networks. We also implement the recurrent TT-Networks and provide numerical evidence of their expressivity. © Learning Representations, ICLR 2018 - Conference Track Proceedings.All right reserved.",,"Convolution; Deep neural networks; Equivalence classes; Tensors; Convolutional networks; Deep architectures; Expressive power; Image patches; Numerical evidence; Score function; Tensor decomposition; Tensor trains; Recurrent neural networks",,,,,"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka: 14.756.31.0001","This study was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (grant 14.756.31.0001).",,,,,,,,,,"Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Zheng, X., (2015) TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, , https://www.tensorflow.org/.Softwareavailablefromtensorflow.org; Buczynska, W., Buczynski, J., Michałek, M., The Hackbusch conjecture on tensor formats (2015) Journal De Mathématiques Pures Et Appliquées, 104 (4), pp. 749-761; Douglas Carroll, J., Chang, J.-J., Analysis of individual differences in multidimensional scaling via an N-way generalization of Eckart-Young decomposition (1970) Psychometrika, 35 (3), pp. 283-319; Cohen, N., Shashua, A., Convolutional rectifier networks as generalized tensor decompositions (2016) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 955-963; Cohen, N., Sharir, O., Shashua, A., On the expressive power of deep learning: A tensor analysis (2016) Conference on Learning Theory, pp. 698-728; Cybenko, G., Approximation by superpositions of a sigmoidal function (1989) Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems (MCSS), 2 (4), pp. 303-314; Delalleau, O., Bengio, Y., Shallow vs. Deep sum-product networks (2011) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 666-674; Eldan, R., Shamir, O., The power of depth for feedforward neural networks (2016) Conference on Learning Theory, pp. 907-940; Gers, F.A., Schmidhuber, J., Cummins, F., (1999) Learning to Forget: Continual Prediction with LSTM; Grasedyck, L., Hierarchical singular value decomposition of tensors (2010) SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 31 (4), pp. 2029-2054; Grasedyck, L., Hackbusch, W., An introduction to hierarchical (H-) rank and TT-rank of tensors with examples (2011) Computational Methods in Applied Mathematics Comput.

RNNs have been widely successful in structured prediction applications such as machine translation or parsing, and are commonly trained using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Unfortunately, this training loss is not always an appropriate surrogate for the test error: by only maximizing the ground truth probability, it fails to exploit the wealth of information offered by structured losses. Further, it introduces discrepancies between training and predicting (such as exposure bias) that may hurt test performance. Instead, SEARNN leverages test-alike search space exploration to introduce global-local losses that are closer to the test error.

Particularly in the case of deep neural networks, it may be too expensive to train the model from scratch each time, so one would rather use a previously learned model and the new data to improve performance. However, deep neural networks are prone to getting stuck in a suboptimal solution when trained on only new data as compared to the full dataset. Our work focuses on a continuous learning setup where the task is always the same and new parts of data arrive sequentially. We apply a Bayesian approach to update the posterior approximation with each new piece of data and find this method to outperform the traditional approach in our experiments. © 6th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2018 - Workshop Track Proceedings.

We propose a probabilistic model and show that Batch Normalization maximizes the lower bound of its marginalized log-likelihood. Then, according to the new probabilistic model, we design an algorithm which acts consistently during train and test. However, inference becomes computationally inefficient. To reduce memory and computational cost, we propose Stochastic Batch Normalization – an efficient approximation of proper inference procedure. This method provides us with a scalable uncertainty estimation technique. We demonstrate the performance of Stochastic Batch Normalization on popular architectures (including deep convolutional architectures: VGG-like and ResNets) for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. © 6th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2018 - Workshop Track Proceedings.

While similar shared tasks were conducted in the past for some Romance and Germanic languages, we explore the performance of sense induction and disambiguation methods for a Slavic language that shares many features with other Slavic languages, such as rich morphology and virtually free word order. The participants were asked to group contexts of a given word in accordance with its senses which were not provided beforehand. For instance, given a word “bank” and a set of contexts for this word, e.g. “bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits” and “river bank is a slope beside a body of water”, a participant was asked to cluster such contexts into unknown in advance number of clusters corresponding to, in this case, the “company” and the “area” senses of the word “bank”. For the purpose of this evaluation campaign, we developed three new evaluation datasets based on sense inventories that have different sense granularity. The contexts in these datasets were sampled from texts of Wikipedia, the academic corpus of Russian, and an explanatory dictionary of Russian. Overall, 18 teams participated in the competition submitting 383 models. Multiple teams managed to substantially outperform competitive state-of-the-art baselines from the previous years based on sense embeddings. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

One of them is the impossibility to rely on human scanning for the identification of unusual/unpredicted astrophysical objects. Moreover, given that most of the available data will be in the form of photometric observations, such characterization cannot rely on the existence of high resolution spectroscopic observations. We introduce an analysis of anomaly detection in the Open Supernova Catalog (http://sne.space/) with use of machine learning. We developed a strategy and pipeline - where anomalous objects are identified and then submitted to careful individual analysis. This project represents an effective strategy to guarantee we shall not overlook exciting new science hidden in the data we fought so hard to acquire. © 2018 Sissa Medialab Srl.

To build a dialogue scenario, we analyze the discourse tree (DT) of an initial query of a customer support dialogue that is frequently complex and multi-sentence. We then enforce rhetorical agreement between DT of the initial query and that of the answers, requests and responses. The chat bot finds answers, which are not only relevant by topic but also suitable for a given step of a conversation and match the question by style, communication means, experience level and other domain-independent attributes. We evaluate a performance of proposed algorithm in car repair domain and observe a 5 to 10% improvement for single and three-step dialogues respectively, in comparison with baseline approaches to dialogue management. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Computational linguistics; Car repair; Chat bots; Customer support; Dialogue management; Domain independents; Performance; Forestry",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ: 16-01-00583, 16-29-12982; National Research University Higher School of Economics, ВШЭ","The work of Dmitry Ilvovsky was supported by RFBR grants 16-29-12982 and 16-01-00583 and was prepared within the framework of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and supported within the framework of a subsidy by the Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'.",,,,,,,,,,"Wilks, Y.

Linguistic components were developed, including a Kazakh-Turkish bilingual dictionary, Constraint Grammar disambiguation rules, lexical selection rules, and structural transfer rules. With many known issues yet to be addressed, our RBMT system has reached performance comparable to publicly-available corpus-based MT systems between the languages. © 2018 The authors.

Innovation is also about something that will work better, than whatever. Healthcare is one of the important areas and it is open to new experts, for contemporary information technologies and innovative start-ups. In such a socially significant sphere as healthcare industry, innovation activity has become vital especially in such areas as automation of physician working place, creation of unified electronic medical record, distribution of intelligent decision support systems for medical solutions, application and wide dissemination of new medical technologies, telemedicine development. The intersection of medicine and ICT has led to the emergence of a new sector of economy - Health IT. The main goal of this research is to identify the most attractive directions for ICT innovations in healthcare industry. This paper deals with the issues of international researches in the field of Health IT innovation. The types of ICT innovations in health care system are quite different and comprise several categories. The authors will consider in detail the next from them: Electronic Health Records, Clinical Decision Support Systems, Telemedicine, and Internet of Things. It is empirical and theoretical research in equal measure. The research is based on literature review, analysis of large volumes of information, and findings of investigations in this field. The theoretical contribution and practical value of the work is based on consideration and analysis of the distinction between implementation of IT innovation in Italian, Russian, and American health care system according to Triple-Helix Model. Research methodology is methods and procedures of system and comparative analysis, deduction by analogy and modelling. The paper also contains the comprehensive review and comparison the types of ICT innovations in healthcare sector, and it focuses on the main characteristics of Clinical Decision Support Systems. © The Authors, 2018.

AGNs can drastically change their spectral appearance in the optical (changing their Seyfert type) and/or in the X-ray region. We illustrate the CL phenomenon with our multi-wavelength monitoring of NGC 2617 and discuss its properties compared with NLS1s. There are few examples of CL NLS1s and the changes are mostly only in the X-ray region. It has been proposed that some of these could be cases of a tidal-disruption events (TDE) or supernova events. If BLRs have a flat geometry and NLS1s are seen face-on then we have to see CL cases only if the orientation of the BLR changes as a result of a TDE or a close encounter of a star without a TDE. If NLS1s include both high Eddington accretion rat and low-inclination AGNs then a significant fraction of NLS1s could be obscured and would not be identified as NLS1s. CL cases might happen more in such objects if dust sublimation occurs following a strong increase in the optical luminosity. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons.",,"Galaxies; Active galactic nuclei; Dust sublimation; Multi-wavelengths; Narrow lines; Seyferts; X ray region; X rays",,,,,"18-32-00553; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 730562","It is our pleasure to thank the organizers of the conference for their invitation and for their excellent organization and the pleasant atmosphere.

In this review, we recall the construction of such Hurwitz Frobenius manifolds as well as the correspondence between semisimple Frobenius manifolds and the topological recursion formalism. We then apply this correspondence to Hurwitz Frobenius manifolds by explaining that the corresponding primary invariants can be obtained as periods of multidifferentials globally defined on a compact Riemann surface by topological recursion. Finally, we use this construction to reply to the following question in a large class of cases: given a compact Riemann surface, what does the topological recursion compute? © 2018 American Mathematical Society.","Frobenius manifolds; Hurwitz spaces; Spectral curve topological recursion",,,,,,"15-31-20832-mola-ved, 16-01-00291, 16-51-45029-Ind; 15-52-50041-YaF; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ: 15-01-05990, 16-31-60044-mol-a-dk; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

We develop a new generative model called Generative Matching Network which is inspired by the recently proposed matching networks for one-shot learning in discriminative tasks. By conditioning on the additional input dataset, our model can instantly learn new concepts that were not available in the training data but conform to a similar generative process. The proposed framework does not explicitly restrict diversity of the conditioning data and also does not require an extensive inference procedure for training or adaptation.

We build on previous scalable GP research including stochastic variational inference based on inducing inputs, kernel interpolation, and structure exploiting algebra. The key idea of our method is to use Tensor Train decomposition for variational parameters, which allows us to train GPs with billions of inducing inputs and achieve state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. Further, our approach allows for training kernels based on deep neural networks without any modifications to the underlying GP model. A neural network learns a multidimensional embedding for the data, which is used by the GP to make the final prediction. We train GP and neural network parameters end-to-end without pretraining, through maximization of GP marginal likelihood. We show the efficiency of the proposed approach on several regression and classification benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Airline.

The key motivations for application of stereotyping in user modeling are resolution of the new user problem and space efficiency. Several claims have been made in the literature related to the effectiveness of stereotyping but only a few studies have validated them empirically. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no empirical study of item-based stereotype models for recommender systems. Our research empirically substantiates the efficacy of using stereotypes in item modeling and user modeling when compared with non-utilization of stereotypes. The empirical evaluation was performed with a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm (gradient boosted decision forests) applied to two datasets integrating MovieLens, IMDb and TMDB movie data. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

We extend the recent framework of Osokin et al. [14] for the quantitative analysis of consistency properties to the case of inconsistent surrogates. Our key technical contribution consists in a new lower bound on the calibration function for the quadratic surrogate, which is non-trivial (not always zero) for inconsistent cases. The new bound allows to quantify the level of inconsistency of the setting and shows how learning with inconsistent surrogates can have guarantees on sample complexity and optimization difficulty. We apply our theory to two concrete cases: multi-class classification with the tree-structured loss and ranking with the mean average precision loss. The results show the approximation-computation trade-offs caused by inconsistent surrogates and their potential benefits. © 2018 Curran Associates Inc..All rights reserved.",,"Economic and social effects; Calibration functions; Consistency property; Machine learning methods; Multi-class classification; Potential benefits; Sample complexity; Technical contribution; Tree-structured; Learning systems",,,,,"Samsung; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: RGPIN-2017-06936; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka: 14.756.31.0001","This work was partly supported by Samsung Research, by Samsung Electronics, by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (grant 14.756.31.0001) and by the NSERC Discovery Grant RGPIN-2017-06936.",,,,,,,,,,"Pires, Á., Bernardo, Ghavamzadeh, Mohammad, Szepesvári, C., Cost-sensitive multiclass classification risk bounds (2013) ICML; Bartlett, P.L., Jordan, M.I., McAuliffe, J.D., Convexity, classification, and risk bounds (2006) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 101 (473), pp. 138-156; Ben-David, S., Loker, D., Srebro, N., Sridharan, K., (2012) Minimizing the Misclassification Error Rate Using a Surrogate Convex Loss; Buffoni, D., Gallinari, P., Usunier, N., Calauzènes, C., Learning scoring functions with order-preserving losses and standardized supervision (2011) ICML; Calauzènes, C., Usunier, N., Gallinari, P., On the (non-)existence of convex, calibrated surrogate losses for ranking (2012) NIPS; Choromanska, A., Agarwal, A., Langford, J., Extreme multi class classification (2013) NIPS Workshop: eXtreme Classification; Ciliberto, C., Rudi, A., Rosasco, L., A consistent regularization approach for structured prediction (2016) NIPS; Crammer, K., Singer, Y., On the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines (2001) Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 2, pp. 265-292; Defazio, A., Bach, F., Lacoste-Julien, S., Saga: A fast incremental gradient method with support for non-strongly convex composite objectives (2014) NIPS; Dorn, W.S., Duality in quadratic programming (1960) Quarterly of Applied Mathematics, 18 (2), pp. 155-162; Duchi, J.C., Mackey, L.W., Jordan, M.I., On the consistency of ranking algorithms (2010) ICML; Long, P., Servedio, R., Consistency versus realizable H-consistency for multiclass classification (2013) ICML; Nemirovski, A., Juditsky, A., Lan, G., Shapiro, A., Robust stochastic approximation approach to stochastic programming (2009) SIAM Journal on Optimization, 19 (4), pp. 1574-1609; Osokin, A., Bach, F., Lacoste-Julien, S., On structured prediction theory with calibrated convex surrogate losses (2017) NIPS; Pedregosa, F., Bach, F., Gramfort, A., On the consistency of ordinal regression methods (2017) Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 18 (55), pp. 1-35; Pillaud-Vivien, L., Rudi, A., Bach, F., Exponential convergence of testing error for stochastic gradient methods (2018) COLT; Ramaswamy, H.G., Agarwal, S., Convex calibration dimension for multiclass loss matrices (2016) Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 17 (14), pp. 1-45; Ramaswamy, H.G., Agarwal, S., Tewari, A., Convex calibrated surrogates for low-rank loss matrices with applications to subset ranking losses (2013) NIPS; Steinwart, I., How to compare different loss functions and their risks (2007) Constructive Approximation, 26 (2), pp. 225-287; Taskar, B., Guestrin, C., Koller, D., Max-margin markov networks (2003) NIPS; Tewari, A., Bartlett, P.L., On the consistency of multiclass classification methods (2007) Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 8, pp. 1007-1025; Tsochantaridis, I., Joachims, T., Hofmann, T., Altun, Y., Large margin methods for structured and interdependent output variables (2005) Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 6, pp. 1453-1484; Zhang, T., Statistical analysis of some multi-category large margin classification methods (2004) Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 5, pp. 1225-1251; Zhang, T., Statistical behavior and consistency of classification methods based on convex risk minimization (2004) Annals of Statistics, 32 (1), pp. 56-134",,"Bengio S.Grauman K.Cesa-Bianchi N.Wallach H.Grauman K.Garnett R.Larochelle H.",,"Neural information processing systems foundation","32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, NeurIPS 2018","2 December 2018 through 8 December 2018",,147412,10495258,,,,"English","Adv. neural inf. proces. syst.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064812943

While being similar to the nearest neighbor search (NNS), the MIPS problem was shown to be more challenging, as the inner product is not a proper metric function. We propose to solve the MIPS problem with the usage of similarity graphs, i.e., graphs where each vertex is connected to the vertices that are the most similar in terms of some similarity function. Originally, the framework of similarity graphs was proposed for metric spaces and in this paper we naturally extend it to the non-metric MIPS scenario. We demonstrate that, unlike existing approaches, similarity graphs do not require any data transformation to reduce MIPS to the NNS problem and should be used for the original data. Moreover, we explain why such a reduction is detrimental for similarity graphs. By an extensive comparison to the existing approaches, we show that the proposed method is a game-changer in terms of the runtime/accuracy trade-off for the MIPS problem. © 2018 Curran Associates Inc..All rights reserved.",,"Economic and social effects; Graphic methods; Learning systems; Metadata; Nearest neighbor search; Computational bottlenecks; Data transformation; Inner product; Machine learning applications; Metric spaces; Non-Metric; Similarity functions; Trade off; Problem solving",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mussmann, S., Ermon, S., Learning and inference via maximum inner product search (2016) Proceedings of the 33nd International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2016, pp. 2587-2596. , New York City, NY, USA, June 19-24, 2016; Mussmann, S., Levy, D., Ermon, S., Fast amortized inference and learning in log-linear models with randomly perturbed nearest neighbor search (2017) Proceedings of the Thirty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, UAI 2017, , Sydney, Australia, August 11-15, 2017; Chandar, S., Ahn, S., Larochelle, H., Vincent, P., Tesauro, G., Bengio, Y., (2016) Hierarchical Memory Networks, , CoRR, abs/1605.07427; Henderson, M., Al-Rfou, R., Strope, B., Sung, Y.-H., Lukács, L., Guo, R., Kumar, S., Kurzweil, R., (2017) Efficient Natural Language Response Suggestion for Smart Reply, , CoRR, abs/1705.00652; Jun, K.-S., Bhargava, A., Nowak, R.D., Willett, R., Scalable generalized linear bandits: Online computation and hashing (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2017, pp. 98-108. , 4-9 December 2017, Long Beach, CA, USA; Keivani, O., Sinha, K., Ram, P., Improved maximum inner product search with better theoretical guarantees (2017) 2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 2927-2934. , May; Neyshabur, B., Srebro, N., On symmetric and asymmetric lshs for inner product search (2015) Proceedings of the 32Nd International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning - Volume 37, ICML'15, pp. 1926-1934. , JMLR.org; Auvolat, A., Vincent, P., (2015) Clustering is Efficient for Approximate Maximum Inner Product Search, , CoRR, abs/1507.05910; Teflioudi, C., Gemulla, R., Exact and approximate maximum inner product search with lemp (2016) ACM Trans.

At the first stage as a result of processing images allocate some set of characteristic properties of some object, and on the second, make identification of object by means of comparison of these properties with properties of the sample. Presence of noise on real images often leads to disturbance of quantity and values in a set of such characteristic properties. In job methods of preliminary processing of images for receiving of set characteristic properties of objects and present methods of the identification are stated, allowing identifying the shape of graphic objects in conditions when the part of a set of characteristic properties of object concerning the sample is absent or is deformed by noise. Feature of the offered methods is their invariance to affine to transformations of the shape of object, and also high speed of identification, not dependent on complexity of identified object.

Opportunities through which firms can achieve the stated strategic goals include accounting services outsourcing. Hence this study is aimed at investigating the role of accounting services outsourcing as a strategic cost management technique using two manufacturing companies at Ilorin, Kwara State as a case study; which are Dangote flour Plc and Doyin investment Nig. Ltd. The result indicates that few accounting processes are outsourced. The respondents, on average, perceived the outsourced accounting services are resulting in net risks. The findings of the study lead to the conclusion that accounting services is important in solving cost management problems of manufacturing companies. This research recommends that the vendor and vendee should see themselves as business partners in the value chain to minimize possible lack of trust. Accounting professional should also develop skills in order to participate in the growing range of outsourcing assignments and be in a better position to render efficient services to clients.

Quantum fluctuations, also known as shot noise, prohibit errorless measurements of the amplitude of electro-magnetic waves, and introduce the so-called standard quantum limit (SQL) on the minimum error of the heterodyne measurements. Nowadays, the sensitivity of modern heterodyne receivers approaches the SQL, and the growing demand for the improvement of measurement precision stimulates a number of both theoretical and experimental efforts to design novel measurement techniques aimed at overcoming the SQL. Here we demonstrate the first steps towards the practical implementation of a sub-SQL quantum receiver. As the principal resources, it requires a highly efficient single-photon counting detector and an interferometer-based scheme for mixing the signal with a low-power local oscillator. We describe the idea of such receiver and its main components. © 2018 29th IEEE International Symposium on Space Terahertz Technology, ISSTT 2018.All Rights Reserved.",,"Heterodyning; Particle beams; Quantum noise; Radio receivers; Astronomical application; Heterodyne measurement; Heterodyne receivers; Measurement precision; Measurement techniques; Quantum noise limit; Single photon counting detectors; Standard quantum limits; Shot noise",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 17-72-30036","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research has been carried out with the support of the Russian Science Foundation (project No. 17-72-30036)",,,,,,,,,,"Helstrom, C.W., Detection theory and quantum mechanics (1967) Inf.

Still not every firm that implemented smart manufacturing reports gathering or making use of big data emerging from those processes, let alone extracting value from them. This study investigates business value creation mechanisms from BDA in smart manufacturing. Relying on several use cases and project stories described in publicly available sources, we analyze key drivers, applications, barriers, success factors, and business benefits of BDA in smart manufacturing. We summarize our findings in a comprehensive framework capturing first- and second-order effects of BDA implementation on Industry 4.0 processes. Our work aims at contributing to the body of knowledge on BDA and smart manufacturing, and at guiding practitioners in identifying and assessing various application scenarios for those technologies. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.","Big data; Big data analytics; Industry 4.0; IT business value; Smart manufacturing","Advanced Analytics; Data Analytics; Data mining; Flow control; Industry 4.0; Information systems; Information use; Application scenario; Body of knowledge; Business benefits; Business value creation; Enterprise data; IT business values; Second order effect; Smart manufacturing; Big data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbasi, A., Sarker, S., Chiang, R.H., Big data research in information systems: Toward an inclusive research agenda (2016) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 17 (2), pp. i-xxxii; Asadi Someh, I., Shanks, G., How business analytics systems provide benefits and contribute to firm performance?

The degree of dissociation between adopted systems to evaluate solutions is analyzed for various participants through the whole supply chain. As a result, a conflict of interests is found between businessmen owning goods, transport companies, consumers, and the society. The basic requirements to logistics in the form of three goals (faster, cheaper, better) develop behavioral models and patterns to take decisions leading to unsafe situations on roads and violations of various requirements to transportation. Following interests of businessmen assessing efficiency using criteria of ROA (return on assets) and the value for business owners results in similar decisions. The paper describes a model of developing ROA elements that are affected by criteria for making decisions during goods transportation and decisions provoking violation of various rules and requirements. This model can provide a basis for a quantitative analysis of the factors' impact on logistics costs and on the value of assets. Model development options depend on the selected method of economic analysis. This model allows revealing primary causes for road accidents, based on reaching the goals to be met through decisions in logistics and goals underlying business efficiency. The approach can also be used in determining trends in motivation of transport operators in observing the requirements and improving transport laws. © 2018 The Author(s).","business efficiency; causes of road accidents; decision-making; logistics KPI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bowersox, D.J., Closs, D.J., (2010) Supply Chain Logistics Management, , Oilmp-Business Moscow; Brooks, A.B., Integrated transportation management (2008) Gower Handbook of Supply Chain Management, pp. 199-218. , Gattorna J.

This makes identification of their topological structure and key elements both important and problematic. In this paper we propose a novel model for influence assessment in such networks using social choice rules. We evaluate node-to-node influence for each layer of the network and consider the problem of influence estimation as a problem of social choice or multi-criteria decision-making. We present various solutions that allow to aggregate information about node-to-node influence into a single vector representing the ranking of nodes or the ranking of the strongest connections in a network. Our approach takes into account individual attributes of nodes, the possibility of their group influence as well as their indirect connections. The presented model is mostly designed networks where there is no clear dependency among the layers. To present our approach we analyze the global trade food network with respect to three main products in order to identify the most important players in the field of food security. © 2018 The Authors.

This paper treats the latter problem dealing with the assignment of tasks to operators under ergonomic constraints. The problem of optimal tasks scheduling in aircraft assembly line is modelled as Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The objective of this research is to assign tasks to operators and to find an optimal schedule of task processing under economic and ergonomic constraints. Two different models to solve this problem are presented and evaluated on an industrial case study. © 2018 The Authors.

It is also found that when increasing the heated substrate temperature above 225 °C, formed microstructure electrical resistivity rises abruptly due to plastic substrate deformation.

The electron diffusivity measurements are performed for such devices. Devices that were fabricated out from 9.9 nm films had diffusivity coefficient of 0.41 cm2/s and from 5.4 nm - 0.54 cm2/s.

Moreover it has a sufficient capacity to meet the needs for rest and recreation of Russian and foreign tourists and residents of the Republic of Buryatia. However, in present time Lake Baikal tourist potential is not achieved. The study included a series of in-depth interviews that were conducted with representatives of the two expert groups: public authority in tourism sector and tour operators' representatives in the analyzed region. The task of in-depth interviews was to get an expert evaluation of the North Baikal tourist potential, identify upcoming trends of tourism development in the region, as well as associated problems and limitations. Moreover the paper presents the study of the Northern Baikal environment as a tourist destination on the basis of PESTEL analysis and SWOT analysis tools.

Still, little evidence exists about what principles should guide their decisions. A product manager’s decision-making has a certain level of subjectivity based on managerial intuition. However, sustainable software product development requires effective long-term decision-making practices. Requirements engineering, as well as release planning and roadmapping, are SPM areas with the highest level of evidence-based decision-making. Still, the clear understanding of evidence-based decision-making practices is missing. The paper provides an analysis of decision-making related to SPM, reveals a spectrum of attitudes and approaches and reports assumptions on whether SPM is based on intuition or if it is evidence-based. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

Research on business aspects of SaaS was usually limited to exploring adoption factors from a consumer perspective. Research on engineering aspects of SaaS focuses primarily on cloud computing architecture and software development. The prime aim of this paper is to assemble these engineering and business aspects of SaaS while building a better understanding of the servitization transformation of software companies as well as classifying, analyzing and putting in correspondence state-of-the-art studies focused on SaaS product and project management, business practices and engineering processes. The mapping study findings and interpretations are summarized to emphasize the significant research challenges regarding the required engineering and business efforts needed for the adoption service-oriented model.

Aggression is seen as a way to resolve conflicts over resources. The features of the aggressive behavior of eusocial insects (ants) are used as a basis. The aggressive component is integrated into the need-emotional architecture of the robot control system, which is presented as a hybrid neuro-production system. The proposed mechanism can be used as a base for implementing various models of social behavior in group robotics. © 2018, Danube Adria Association for Automation and Manufacturing, DAAAM.

The practice of identifying people in Russia and the UK was studied and compared. Russia was selected because its legislation is well known to the authors, and the UK was selected as it has developed a mature system for the online identification of individuals and relationships and a certain legal regulation in this sphere. An analysis of two government programs was made, namely: the UK Identity Assurance Programme of the Government Digital Service and the Russian Government Decree on “The development of the Federal state information system”. In terms of technological background for person’s identification, the practice of using IPv4 and IPv6 was explored. Russia's specific problems are analysed via the protection of privacy in the case of personal identification and the processing of personal data on the Internet. The authors draw conclusions about the division of the concepts of identification and individualization of people on the Internet. We introduce our own definition of personal identification on the Internet and propose an amendment to the Russian concept of personal data: the definition of personal data should include the IP address of a person. © 2018, Danube Adria Association for Automation and Manufacturing, DAAAM.

It is a complex data-driven process, which tries to forecast future states of company assets. On one hand it prerequisites condition monitoring of components on machine level. On the other hand it demands the integration of the collected data with other management information systems. Digitization and especially the advent of big data science bring along promising opportunities to create effective smart monitoring and predictive maintenance applications. The aim of this research is to examine the possibilities of a predictive maintenance framework based on the design principles of Industry 4.0 and recent developments in distributed computing, Big Data and Machine Learning. It introduces numerous enabling technologies such as industrial Internet of things, standardized communication protocols, as well as edge and cloud computing. Moreover, it takes a deeper look at data analytical techniques and tools, and analyses performance of well-known machine learning algorithms. Paper proposes architecture of a predictive maintenance framework based on existing software and hardware solutions. As a proof of concept, a real-life smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) application system is created and tested to demonstrate the possibilities of the proposed PdM framework. © 2018, Danube Adria Association for Automation and Manufacturing, DAAAM.

The arrays often natively come as raster files while standalone command line tools are one of the most popular ways for processing these files. Decades of development and feedback resulted in numerous feature-rich, elaborate, free and quality-assured tools optimized mostly for a single machine. ChronosDB partially delegates in situ data processing to such tools and offers a formal N-d array data model to abstract from the files and the tools.

In Russia, the interest to valuation is related directly with development of legislation protecting intellectual property rights. The standards of intangibles valuation that have been accepted in Russia, are based on the principles of IFRS, thus making appropriate the commonly used approaches, among which the discounted cash flow (DCF) based approach has the most importance. The formula method has become quite widespread in global economic practice, as an approach for assessment of the part of intangible assets that is not accounted in bookkeeping records. For example, the standard procedure of application of this method is presented in depth in Handbook of Business Valuation. Contributors: Thomas L. West - Editor, Jeffrey D. Jones - Editor. (1999). The analysis algorithm is limited to four operations: 1. Determine the value of tangible assets and liabilities. 2. Calculate the size of the representative operational profit. 3. Determine the required rates of return on tangible assets. These indicators are used for calculation of profits on tangible assets, which are then to be deducted from the representative operational profit in order to define the “surplus profit” value. 4. Determine the required rate of return on intangible assets. This value is used for calculation of intangible assets, or “goodwill”. Subsequently, total company value may be determined by adding the “goodwill” value to the net tangible assets value determined as described in clause 1. A similar approach is followed by Reilly R. Jr, Schweihs R., Reilly R. (2004) Abrams J.B (2010) Copeland T., Koller .T, Murrn J.et al. (2000). Damodaran A.(2002). The levers concept represented by the authors (Tkachenko et al., 2016) enables the approach to be changed to attributing a value to intellectual assets which are subject to the specific features of a shipbuilding company. The specific nature of shipbuilding products is the small-series production, wherein each vessel in the series can have additional unique characteristics that require significant development work and preparation of design and engineering documentation. The problem of placing a value on the unique technological solutions being created and their inclusion into intangible assets involves modification of the existing methodology of valuation. In their article, the authors propose a modified methodology of valuation based on the formula method taking into account the technological lever, human capital assets lever and the brand lever. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The industry is a capital intensive one for all stages from exploration to delivery. Two types of supplies: pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), recently have faced a direct intra-industrial competition. Physical nature of methane and associated transportation costs lead to domination of so-called ""natural monopolies"" or ""national champions"" and strict government regulation, which postponed the development of free trade and competition. After decades of technical innovations and cost curve improvement in LNG sector, increasing global energy consumption, shale boom in the USA, and demand for supply diversification reformulated the role of gas in the global energy balance. While the pipeline sector remains to be in the hands of large corporations and a subject of strategic interstate and international agreements, LNG provides more diversity and flexibility of trade. However, even after a long history of LNG shipment since the late 1950s, this market is still regional with high spreads between countries and terms of delivery. The paper presents the evolution of business models in the natural gas industry, focusing on the primary drivers as government regulation, technologies, and regional markets trends on the way to liberalization and cointegration. Thus, our primary objective is to show relative influence power of these drivers. This analysis also defines the competitiveness of corporate business model under conditions of asymmetric information in regional gas markets, deregulation trends, fast-growing production technologies and downstream infrastructure (specifically in the LNG sector). We also enclose the analysis of the most globally competitive gas projects. We analyze changes in value chain change and trading contracts. Our methodological approach poses model-based principles, including option and contract models, jointly with game theory elements. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Competition; Deregulation; Energy utilization; Game theory; Gas industry; Gases; International trade; Natural gas transportation; Office buildings; Petroleum prospecting; Pipelines; Asymmetric information; Government regulation; Industrial competition; Industrial production; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Methodological approach; Primary energy source; Technical innovation; Liquefied natural gas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arapostathis, S., Pearson, P.J.G., Foxon, T.J., UK natural gas system integration in the making, 1960-2010: Complexity, transitional uncertainties and uncertain transitions (2014) Environ.

A particular example of such an algebra is the so-called Reflection Equation algebra In this paper we analyze its specific properties, which distinguish it from other quantum matrix algebras (in first turn, from the RTT one). Thus, we exhibit a specific form of the Cayley-Hamilton identity for its generating matrix, which in a limit turns into the Cayley-Hamilton identity for the generating matrix of the enveloping algebra U(gl(m)). Also, we consider some specific properties of the braided Yangians, recently introduced by the authors. In particular, we exhibit an analog of the Cayley-Hamilton identityfor the generating matrix of such a braided Yangian. Besides, by passing to a limit of this braided Yangian, we get a Lie algebra similar to that entering the construction of the rational Gaudin model. In its enveloping algebra we construct a Bethe subalgebra by the method due to D.Talalaev. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Affinization; Braided Lie algebra; Braided Yangian; Cayley-Hamilton identity; Quantum symmetric polynomials; Reflection equation algebra","Graph Databases; Mechanics; Affinization; Braided Lie algebras; Braided Yangian; Cayley-Hamilton; Symmetric polynomial; Matrix algebra",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 16-01-00562","Acknowledgments.

At rest, the effective connectomes of the patients and healthy subjects had significant differences in the strength of connections. Immunological data analysis showed that despite clinical improvement after inpatient treatment, most patients had elevated levels of markers of systemic inflammation and activation of humoral immunity.

In humans, the recording by microelectrode matrices reveals only fragments of such waves. Our basic assumption is that the source of the EEG/MEG in the alpha and beta bands are radial traveling waves. Similar waves are generated in the networks of recurrently coupled neurons, where excitation is propagated through intracortical connections. We simulated traveling waves on the surface of the human brain and compared the simulation data with the experimental signals of the evoked and spontaneous MEG. Model waves were assigned a number of epicenters in the ROI on the cortical surface, different propagation velocities, and phase. The frequency of the model wave was determined from the spectral and wavelet analyzes. Correlation data allowed us to localize radial waves and to select their parameters in the postcentral sulcus with stimulation of the median nerve and in the cuneus sulcus at rest in healthy human adults. Our approach resulted in a successful reconstruction of the radial waves' dynamics on individual brain surfaces. © 2018 The Author(s).","Brain; Cortex; Intra-cortical propagation hypothesis; Large scale brain networks; MEG; Traveling waves","Microelectrodes; Network architecture; Animal experiments; Brain networks; Cortex; Cortical surfaces; Intra-cortical propagation hypothesis; Intracortical connections; Propagation velocities; Traveling wave; Brain",,,,,"National Rehabilitation Center, NRC: 1378","The work was partially supported by an internal grant of the NRC “Kurchatov Institute a imed at studying the role of brain’s multilevel architecture in brain-computer interfaces (order No 1378 from 23.08.2017), as well as by RFBR grants ofi-m 17-29-02518 and 17-04-02211.",,,,,,,,,,"Hughes, J.R., The phenomenon of travelling waves: A review (1995) Clin.

We show that simple averaging of multiple points along the trajectory of SGD, with a cyclical or constant learning rate, leads to better generalization than conventional training. We also show that this Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) procedure finds much broader optima than SGD, and approximates the recent Fast Geometric Ensem-bling (FGE) approach with a single model. Using SWA we achieve notable improvement in test accuracy over conventional SGD training on a range of state-of-the-art residual networks, PyramidNets, DenseNets, and ShakeShake networks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In short, SWA is extremely easy to implement, improves generalization, and has almost no computational overhead. © 34th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence 2018.

While in principle our approach is a straightforward marginalization, it requires solving many related MAP inference problems. We show that for log-supermodular pairwise models these operations can be performed efficiently using the machinery of dynamic graph cuts. We also propose to use double stochastic gradient descent, both on the data and on the perturbations, for efficient learning.

Such systems are mainly developed by large companies for specific domains. At the same time, small companies don’t have the necessary resources to develop their own unique systems. Therefore, they need universal recommendation system (or recommender platform) automatically customized for a specific domain. This system allows to develop own recommendation system from scratch for companies whose services are under development. The RNN-based approach is proposed for session-based recommendation with automatically modelling of the domain. This approach is based on the content analysis of the web sites. Several modifications to classic RNNs such as a ranking loss function that make it more viable for this specific problem are considered. General scheme of the approach and architecture of the recommendation system based on proposed scheme are described in this paper.

The authors follow an approach similar to [Blinov, Kotelnikov, 2014], but applied to a different domain and using different parameters. The authors also present a new dataset that is made available to the community. To build the vector space of words with word2vec, a corpus comprising 50 329 hotel reviews was constructed. The next step was the compilation of aspect and sentiment lexicons in the vector space obtained. The lexicon construction approach was based on iteratively expanding a small set of initially specified terms. Finally, the sentiment of aspects in actual reviews was calculated given the aspect and sentiment terms found in the text and their weights, i.e. cosine similarity to the initial terms. The model was tested on a corpus of 6 876 texts from the same domain. © 2017 CEUR-WS.

The models use dictionaries of morphs and words and information about the part of speech and other morphological features of the word.

This article also presents a comparison of the results of the experiment and numerical simulation. The impact of transverse magnetic field on a flow structure and heat transfer in a vertical pipe was studied. Experimental studies were performed in the Reynolds number range (Re = 4000-20000) under the influence of a magnetic field (Ha = 13-14). Numerical calculations were estimate in the same ranges of Reynolds numbers and Hartman numbers which were 13-30. The paper is about comparison of results. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Fused salts; Magnetic fields; Nuclear reactors; Numerical models; Reynolds number; Turbulent flow; Down flows; Hartman numbers; Heat exchange; Heated pipes; Molten salt; Numerical calculation; Transverse magnetic field; Vertical pipes; Heat transfer",,,,,"Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, RSCF","Work is supported by RSCF, project 17-19-01745 The experiments were conducted at the UNU""Mercury Stand""",,,,,,,,,,"Kovalchuk, M.V., Azizov, E.A., (2009) PAS&T., 3; Azizov, E.A., (2011) Atomic Energy, 2, p. 84; Velikhov, E.P., Kovalchuk, M.V., Ilgisonis, V.I., (2017) PAS&T., 4, p. 5; Serp, J., (2014) Progress in Nuclear Energy, 77, p. 308; Ignatiev, V.V., (2007) Thesis for the degree of Doctor of Technical Sciences in Russian, , (Moscow: RRC quot;Kurchatov Institutequot;); Yokomine, T.T., (2007) Fusion Science and Technology, 52 (3), p. 625; Takeuchi, J., (2006) Fusion Engineering and Design, 81 (1-7), p. 601; Takeuchi, J., (2008) Fusion Engineering and Design, 83 (7-9), p. 1082; Nakaharai, H., (2007) Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science, 32 (1), p. 23; Belyaev, I.A., (2017) Thermal Engineering, 64 (11), p. 841; Belyaev, I.A., (2018) Magnetohydrodynamics, , in press; Zikanov, O., (2013) J.

The formation of plasma spots with the parameters necessary for the initiation and development of a lightning discharge in a thundercloud is regarded as a nonequilibrium phase transition induced by electrostatic noise. The noise is caused by the collective dynamics of charged hydrometeors, i.e., ice particles and water drops suspended in a convective flow. The interaction of plasma formations and their polariza- tion in a large-scale intracloud electric field ensure the efficient generation of streamers, whose description in terms of random graphs and percolation theory forms the basis for the phenom- enological representation of discharge as a fractal dissipative structure. This approach enables solving a number of key pro- blems surrounding thunderstorm electricity, including the light- ning initiation mechanism in essentially subthreshold electric fields, the properties and morphology of various types of light- ning discharges, and a self-consistent description of the broad- band electromagnetic radiation they emit. Prospects for the further development of the model are discussed and the role of forthcoming satellite experiments in the observation of intense electromagnetic radiation from thunderstorm clouds is examined. © 2018 Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk.","Atmospheric electricity; Physics of lightning; Satel- lite observations of lightning discharges","Atmospheric electricity; Electromagnetic wave emission; Electromagnetic waves; Graph theory; Lightning; Satellites; Solvents; Thunderstorms; Atmospheric discharge; Dissipative structure; Initiation mechanism; Lightning discharge; Nonequilibrium phase transitions; Satellite observations; Self-consistent description; Thunderstorm electricity; Electric discharges",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 17-12-01439","This study was supported by the Russian Science Foundation grant 17-12-01439.",,,,,,,,,,"Christian, H.J., (2003) J.

This interaction determines the global structure of the heliosphere (the region occupied by the solar wind) and has a complex multicomponent character. We describe the three-di- mensional kinetic-magnetohydrodynamic model of the interac- tion, which includes plasma and neutral components of the interstellar medium and solar wind, the heliospheric and inter- stellar magnetic fields, and the latitudinal and temporal varia- tions of solar wind parameters. In describing the results, magnetic-field-related effects are given special attention, in particular, the magnetic-field-driven plasma depletion in the vicinity of the heliopause. The model explains a sufficiently large body of data from Voyager-1 and Voyager-2, the Inter- stellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and other spacecraft. Based on the experimental data and using the model, the parameters of the interstellar medium and of the interstellar magnetic field are determined. It is shown, how- ever, that a single model using a single set of boundary condi- tions cannot self-consistently explain all the data available. The Voyager-1 data on the scattered solar Lyman-alpha radiation is taken as an example to illustrate the difficulties that arise. © 2018 Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk.","Interstellar atoms; Interstellar medium; Magnetohydrodynamics; Shock waves; Solar wind","Magnetohydrodynamics; Shock waves; Solar wind; Stars; Hubble space telescopes; Interstellar magnetic fields; Interstellar mediums; Lyman-alpha radiation; Magnetohydrodynamic model; Solar and heliospheric observatories; Solar wind parameters; Stellar magnetic fields; Magnetoplasma",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 16-52-16008","The author is grateful to his colleagues D B Aleksashov, I I Baliukin, and O A Katushkina for joint studies.

In this case, the coefficients of the nonlinear controller are determined by solving Riccati matrix equation with state dependent parameters. A realizability problem of the controller of this sort is computational complexity of the realtime solution. The proposed approach solves the problem by controller coefficients searching at each control time subinterval of the whole control time interval. The presented methodology is illustrated by designing chemotherapy administration for the cancer treatment. The mathematical model of the cancer growth includes interaction between tumor cells, healthy normal cells and activated immune cells.

The linear structure of the transformed nonlinear system and the quadratic functional of quality allow for the synthesis of optimal control, i.e. parameters of the regulator, move from the need to search for solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to an equation of the Riccati type with parameters that depend on the state. The main problem of implementing optimal control is related to the problem of finding a solution to such an equation at the pace of object functioning. The paper proposes an algorithmic method of parametric optimization of the regulator. This method is based on the use of the necessary conditions for the optimality of the control system under consideration. The constructed algorithms can be used both to optimize the non-stationary objects themselves, if the corresponding parameters are selected for this purpose, and to optimize the entire managed system by means of the corresponding parametric adjustment of the regulators. The example of drug treatment of patients with HIV is demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed algorithms. © 2018","Nonlinear differential equations; optimal control; the Hamilton-Jacobi equation; the Pontryagin minimum principle; the Riccati equation with parameters that depend on the state","Control system synthesis; Controlled drug delivery; Mechanics; Nonlinear systems; Parameter estimation; Quality control; Riccati equations; Hamilton - Jacobi equations; Nonlinear differential equation; Optimal controls; Pontryagin minimum principle; the Riccati equation with parameters that depend on the state; Nonlinear equations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atans, M., Falb, P., (1968) Optimal control., , Mechanical engineering Moscow; Afanasyev, V.N., Kolmanovskyi, V.B., Nosov, V.R., (2003) Mathematical theory of control system design., , High school Moscow; Afanasyev, V.N., (2015) Control of nonlinear uncertain dynamic objects., , URSS Moscow; Bellman, R., (1957) Dynamic programming., , Princeton University Press Princeton; (2008), pp. 3771-3775. , Cimen T.D.

Building a lexicon of discourse connectives is an indispensable subtask in many discourse parsing applications as well as an essential issue in theoretical researches of text coherence. In order to develop such a resource for Russian, we have conducted a corpus-based study of discourse connectives that were manually extracted from the Russian Rhetorical Structure Treebank (Ru-RSTreebank). The Treebank includes 79 texts annotated within the RST framework [Mann, Thompson 1988]. In order to provide a deeper analysis of connectives in Russian, we focus on causal relations only, namely, the ‘Cause-Effect’ relation. Some of the connectives (primary connectives) are enumerated in grammars and dictionaries. They primarily mark the intra-sentential relations. However, there is an expansive class of less grammaticalized items (secondary connectives) that have received less attention till now. Some of them are based on content words (e.g. по причине ‘for the cause’). Secondary connectives often serve as linking devices for inter-sentential relations. We suggest a scheme for connectives annotation for Russian. We specify the basic patterns that can be used for less-grammaticalized connectives mining in an unannotated corpus. Besides, we provide the comparison of two classes of connectives (primary vs. secondary ones). Our research has shown that these two classes differ in their properties.

However, will the fact that these nouns are less frequent than masculine nouns ending in a consonant or feminine nouns ending in -a/ja play a role for online subject-predicate agreement processing? Or will subject-predicate agreement processing be more problematic with subjects of a certain gender? Finally, some final consonants are more characteristic for feminine gender, while the others for masculine gender. Are speakers sensitive to this? We present two experiments addressing these questions. We found that all three factors play a role, but for different tasks (online agreement processing or determining the gender of a novel word) and at different processing stages. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet.All Rights Reserved.","Declension; Experimental; Grammatical gender; Russian",,,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF","The study was supported in part by the grant #161802071 from the Russian Science Foundation.",,,,,,,,,,"Acuña-Fariña, J.C., Meseguer, E., Carreiras, M., Gender and number agreement in comprehension in Spanish (2014) Lingua, 143, pp. 108-128; Akhutina, T., Kurgansky, A., Polinsky, M., Bates, E., Processing of grammatical gender in a threegender system: Experimental evidence from Russian (1999) Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 28, pp. 695-713; Akhutina, T., Kurgansky, A., Kurganskaya, M., Polinsky, M., Natalya Polonskaya, Larina, O., Bates, E., Appelbaum, M., Processing of grammatical gender in normal and aphasic speakers of Russian (2001) Cortex, 37, pp. 295-326; Alexeeva, S., Slioussar, N., Chernova, D., StimulStat: A lexical database for Russian (2018) To Appear in: Behavior Research Methods; Andonova, E., D’Amico, S., Devescovi, A., Bates, E., Gender and lexical access in Bulgarian (2004) Perception and Psychophysics, 66, pp. 496-507; Anton-Mendez, I., Nicol, J., Garrett, M.F., The relation between gender and number agreement processing (2002) Syntax, 5, pp. 1-25; Badecker, W., Kuminiak, F., Morphology, agreement and working memory retrieval in sentence production: Evidence from gender and case in Slovak (2007) Journal of Memory and Language, 56, pp. 65-85; Bates, E., Devescovi, A., Pizzamiglio, L., D’Amico, S., Hernandez, A., Gender and lexical access in Italian (1995) Perception and Psychophysics, 57, pp. 847-862; Bock, K., Eberhard, K.M., Meaning, sound and syntax in English number agreement (1993) Language and Cognitive Processes, 8, pp. 57-99; Caffarra, S., Siyanova-Chanturia, A., Pesciarelli, F., Vespignani, F., Cacciari, C., Is the noun ending a cue to grammatical gender processing?

While similar shared tasks were conducted in the past for some Romance and Germanic languages, we explore the performance of sense induction and disambiguation methods for a Slavic language that shares many features with other Slavic languages, such as rich morphology and virtually free word order. The participants were asked to group contexts of a given word in accordance with its senses which were not provided beforehand. For instance, given a word “bank” and a set of contexts for this word, e.g. “bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits” and “river bank is a slope beside a body of water”, a participant was asked to cluster such contexts into unknown in advance number of clusters corresponding to, in this case, the “company” and the “area” senses of the word “bank”. For the purpose of this evaluation campaign, we developed three new evaluation datasets based on sense inventories that have different sense granularity. The contexts in these datasets were sampled from texts of Wikipedia, the academic corpus of Russian, and an explanatory dictionary of Russian. Overall, 18 teams participated in the competition submitting 383 models. Multiple teams managed to substantially outperform competitive state-of-the-art baselines from the previous years based on sense embeddings. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet.All Rights Reserved.","Homonymy; Lexical semantics; Polysemy; Word sense disambiguation; Word sense induction",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 16-37-00354 мол_а; Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 16-18-02054","This research was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under the projects JOIN-T and ACQuA and by the RFBR under the project no. 16-37-00354 мол_а.

The aim of the research was to find out what types of speech acts commonly initiate and complete everyday dialogues, as well as to reveal the most typical sequences of speech acts in these dialogues. Altogether, 2230 speech acts of 30 people referring to both professional, and household conversations have been analysed. N-gram analysis has been used to calculate the most frequent sequences of speech acts. The obtained results showed that dialogues are usually started by representatives, i. e. speech acts related to the exchange of information (38% of all cases), etiquette beginnings (greetings, vocatives) take place in 23% of the dialogues, and in 19% of cases the conversation begins with a regulative form. Speech acts ending dialogues show a greater variety: representatives contribute 2% of all dialogue ends, valuative judgments and regulatory forms cover 14% each, further go directives (8%), commissions (8%), etiquette forms (8%) and emotional and expressive form (7%). As for the most typical bigrams of speech acts, they are the following: two consecutive representatives (22.35%), a regulatory form followed by a representative (6.93%), a representative and a regulatory form (6%), a valuative with a following representative (5.21%), a representative and a valuative judgment (4.77%), as well as two combinations of a directive with a representative (2.77% each). Besides, the article presents data on the occurrence of the most frequent pairs of speech acts at the subtype level. Here, the most frequent one is the sequence question+answer, which covers 2.45%. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet.All Rights Reserved.","Dialogue structure; Everyday speech communication; N-gram; Oral discourse; Speech act; Speech corpus; Spoken Russian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, J., Core, M., (1997) Draft of DAMSL: Dialog Act Markup in Several Layers, , https://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/speech/damsl/RevisedManual/, Online at: last accessed on Feb. 17, 2018; Asinovsky, А., Bogdanova, N., Rusakova, М., Ryko, A., Stepanova, S., Sherstinova, T., The ORD Speech Corpus of Russian Everyday Communication «One Speaker’s Day»: Creation Principles and Annotation, TSD 2009 (2009) LNAI, 5729, pp. 250-257; Austin, J.L., (1962) How To Do Things With Words, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bakhtin, M.M., (1986) Speech Genres and Other Late Essays, , Univ. of Texas Press, Austin, TX; Blum-Kulka, S., Olshtain, E., (1984) Requests and Apologies: A CrossCultural Study of Speech Act Realization Patterns (CCSARP) Applied Linguistics, 5 (3), pp. 196-213; Bogdanova-Beglarian, N., Sherstinova, T., Blinova, O., Ermolova, O., Baeva, E., Martynenko, G., Ryko, A., Sociolinguistic Extension of the ORD Corpus of Russian Everyday Speech (2016) SPECOM 2016, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, 9811, pp. 659-666. , Ronzhin, A. et al. eds LNAI,.

Subject indexes usually contain particular single-word and multi-word terms from the corresponding documents. Such indexes are especially useful for reading large documents with specialized terminology, as well as educational texts in difficult scientific and technical areas. The central problem of back-of-the-book indexing is recognition of terms to be included into the index. The paper describes a method developed for extracting and filtering terms from a given educational scientific text, with the purpose of reliable term selection in computer indexing systems. The method is primarily based on rules with lexico-syntactic patterns representing linguistic information about terms and typical contexts of their usage in Russian scientific and educational texts; simple occurrences statistics of terms is used as well. Experimental evaluation of the method has shown a considerable increase of precision and recall of term extraction compared with the widely-used standard techniques. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet.All Rights Reserved.","Back-of-the-book index; Educational scientific texts; Lexico-syntactic patterns; Rule-based term extraction; Subject indexing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arora, C., Sabetzadeh, M., Briand, L., Zimmer, F., Automated extraction and clustering of requirements glossary terms (2016) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 43 (10), pp. 918-945; Aubin, S., Hamon, T., Improving term extraction with terminological resources (2006) Advances in Natural Language Processing, pp. 380-387. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Bolshakova, E., Efremova, N., Noskov, A., LSplpatterns as a tool for information extraction from natural language texts (2010) New Trends in Classification and Data Mining, pp. 110-118. , ITHEA, Sofia; Bolshakova, E.I., Efremova, N.E., A heuristics strategy for extracting terms from scientific texts, analysis of images, social networks and texts (2015) Fourth Int.

To this effect we propose and analyze a randomized block cubic Newton (RBCN) method, which in each iteration builds a model of the objective function formed as the sum of the natural models of its three components: A linear model with a quadratic regular- izer for the differentiable term, a quadratic model with a cubic regularizer for the twice differentiable term, and perfect (proximal) model for the nonsmooth term. Our method in each iteration minimizes the model over a random subset of blocks of the search variable. RBCN is the first algorithm with these properties, generalizing several existing methods, matching the best known bounds in all special cases. We establish 0(1/e), e>(l/-v/c) and O(log(l/e)) rates under different assumptions on the component functions. Lastly, we show numerically that our method outperforms the state of the art on a variety of machine learning problems, including cubically regularized least- squares, logistic regression with constraints, and Poisson regression. © 2018 35th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2018.

The main advantage of complex modeling (CM) is that the combined use of alternative models, methods and algorithms allows to compensate their objectively existing shortcomings and limitations while enhancing their positive qualities. In the paper, this advantage of CM is illustrated by the example of interconnection AMO ACS analytical logic-dynamic model for planning and scheduling with Petri net simulation model of possible scenarios for the implementation of the corresponding plans under conditions of various kinds of disturbing influences. © Institute of Information Science.

In order to calculate the optimal configuration of the VM, a machine learning Q-algorithm has been implemented.

Nowadays it is agreed that we should aim to make education more effective and personalized and automate as much routine operations as possible. The area of educational systems for mathematical disciplines has some special requirements. For such disciplines it is essential to preserve the technique of learning by training in multiple examples. i.e. The training tasks with an answer given in a form of mathematical expression. In the present paper a framework for training tasks automatization is described. The appropriate technique is implemented in the EdLeTS educational system which aims to support practical classes on various mathematical disciplines and provides tools for training tasks automatization. A brief overview of EdLeTS is given. Automatic answer checking is the most complex aspect of training tasks automatization. The Richardson's theorem states that in general case there exists no algorithm for functions comparison. As a result, there is no way to guarantee the correctness of answer checking in math educational systems using symbolic calculations. We suggest a workaround for this problem: an additional pointwise checking procedure. This procedure compares the values of the functions being examined in a number of randomly chosen points. Such a comparison may lead to an error. In this paper an analysis of the probability of such an error is given. It is shown that under some fair conditions such an algorithm can be successfully used in practice. © WMSCI 2018 - 22nd World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, Proceedings.

Though intellectual capital measurement and reporting is typically associated with private and listed companies, educational institutions also need to handle contemporary challenges as they mainly use and produce intangible resources. Schools, universities and research centers encounter increasing demand for transparency in reporting for stakeholders. The research field of IC in education is gaining popularity. But the majority of articles cover universities and other higher education institutions. There is a scarcity of IC measurement and reporting projects at secondary and primary education level. The country-specific IC context is also of potential interest for the researchers, managers, and policy makers in education. This paper represents the research project at the proposal stage. Our research goal is to investigate the current status quo of IC application in school education in St. Petersburg, Russia. First, we complete the content analysis of strategic documents to check if there is an established language for IC measurement, reporting and management in schools. Next, we use semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to analyze the importance of and country-specific and context-specific IC measurements, applications and adaptations from the stakeholders’ point of view. The research plan and the preliminary results of the content analysis are presented below. © 2018 Academic Conferences Limited.","Educational institution; Intellectual capital; Public sector; School education; Schools","Knowledge management; Surveys; Timing circuits; Educational institutions; Intellectual capital; Public sector; School education; Schools; Integrated circuits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andreeva, T., Sergeeva, A., Golubeva, A., Pavlov, J., Obmen znaniyami mezhdu uchitelyami srednikh shkol: Faktory, vliyayushchie na ego intensivnost” [Knowledge Exchange between High School Teachers: Factors of Intensity (2013) Voprosy Obrazovaniya / Educational Studies, (2), pp. 154-187. , Moscow; Bezhani, I., Intellectual capital reporting at UK universities (2010) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 11 (2), pp. 179-207; Bisogno, M., Dumay, J., Rossi, F., Polcini, P., Identifying future directions for ic research in education: A literature review (2018) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 19 (1), pp. 10-33; Bornemann, M., Wiedenhofer, R., Intellectual capital in education: A value chain perspective (2014) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 15 (3), pp. 451-470; Cheng, E., Knowledge sharing for creating school intellectual capital (2015) Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 191, pp. 1455-1459; Cheng, E., Knowledge management strategies for capitalising on school knowledge (2017) VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems, 47 (1), pp. 94-109; Dumay, J., Guthrie, J., Rooney, J., The critical path of intellectual capital (2017) The Routledge Companion to Intellectual Capital: Frontiers of Research, Practice and Knowledge, pp. 21-39. , Guthrie, J., Dumay, J., Ricceri, F. and Nielsen, C.

In view of the increasing competition for human capital the environmental problems of megacities have taken on even greater significance. Highly qualified personnel impose high demands for the quality of the environment. Regional authorities face a set of challenges related to the reduction of technogenic and anthropogenic loads on the environment. The established practice for territorial administration is based on the program- and goal-oriented approach and does not correlate with the complex tasks being solved frequently. Modern tools including the system of balanced scorecard and various intellectual capital navigators are currently being tested, which raises strong objections from regional authorities. To solve the problems of environmental development effectively, we should reach a balance between the interests of policymakers, population and business. Current contradictions require developing a special mechanism for finding common ground. The choice of management methods and development of management decisions should be based on the principles of systematic approach and feedback. The organization of knowledge and information flows as well as ensuring efficient knowledge exchange are of great importance for delivering an adequate regional policy. As part of the study, the authors have substantiated the possibility of applying knowledge management methods and tools for regional environmental development management and have undertaken the research of key regional stakeholders' response to the management activities aimed at improving the environmental situation as well as the impact both prior to and after applying knowledge management tools. © 2018 Academic Conferences Limited.","Environmental science; Knowledge management; Regional administration","Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Personnel; Regional planning; Research and development management; Environmental development; Environmental problems; Environmental science; Goal-oriented approach; Knowledge management methods; Knowledge management tool; Management activities; Organization of knowledge; Knowledge management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, C., Roberts, P., You are what you measure (1993) Manufacturing Europe 1993; Armstrong, K., The open method of coordination–governance after Lisbon (2006) Journal of Contemporary European Research, 2 (1), pp. 1-104; Castells, M., (2000) The Information Age, Economy, Society and Culture, 1. , 2004; Cruz da, N.F., Marques, R.C., Scorecards for sustainable local governments (2014) Cities, 39, pp. 165-170. , August 2014; Dang, D., Umemoto, K., Modeling the development toward the knowledge economy: A national capability approach (2009) Journal of Knowledge Management, 13 (5), pp. 359-372; Fischer, S., Gran, S., Hacker, B., Jakobi, A.P., Petzold, S., Pusch, T., Steinberg, P., (2010) Europe 2020” – Proposals for The Post-Lisbon Strategy, , http://www.fes.de/ipa, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung.

Based on longitudinal data we explore the differences between career paths of workers that had the experience of vocational training and workers without such experience. We contribute the debate regarding vocational training and its role in innovation and economic development utilizing methodology of sequence analysis and Markov chains with long memory (mixture transition distribution models (MTD)). MTD models suggest the analysis of categorical data sequences instead of quantitative data that is standard for this kind of research. Such methodological approach allows not only estimating casual effects of participation in vocational education programs on the wage level, but exploring how vocational training influences the whole career path. Our findings suggest that those workers who participate in vocational training have lower probability of different negative events in their careers including job loss. Moreover, mixture transitions distribution models suggest that for such workers the current career status determined by longer history of previous career events than for those employees that had not any experience of participation in vocational education programs. These results give the evidence that vocational education is important factor of success on the labour market, providing greater flexibility of career paths that is crucial in innovation development of the labour market and economy as a whole. Findings of the study also have important policy implications. Importance of vocational training on individual level suggests that investment in vocational education on societal level will bring positive returns. This kind of education provides the flexibility of individuals on the labour market, through vocational training workers obtain new skills and knowledge that allows them utilizing new technologies and innovations. Development of vocational education may be considered as policy-making instrument that can generate positive economic outcomes. © 2018 Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE.

Aggregation of the features of individual frames extracted using deep convolutional neural networks are used in order to obtain a descriptor of video track. The tracks with identical faces are grouped using the known face verification algorithms and clustering methods. We experimentally compare frame aggregation methods using the YouTubeFaces dataset and contemporary neural networks (VGGFace, VGGFace2, LightenedCNN). It is shown that the most accurate video-based face verification is achieved with the L2-normalization of average unnormalized features of individual frames of each video track. Finally, we demonstrate that the best video grouping is obtained by sequential and rank-order clustering methods. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

We have examined previous longitudinal research of age-related voice changes as well as its applicability to real world use cases. Our findings reveal that scientists have treated age-related voice changes as a hindrance instead of leveraging it to the advantage of the identity validator. Additionally, we found a significant dearth of publicly available corpora related to both the time span of and the number of participants in audio recordings. We also identified a significant bias toward the development of speaker recognition technologies applicable to government surveillance systems compared to speaker verification systems used in civilian IT security systems. To solve the aforementioned issues, we built an open project with the largest publicly available longitudinal speaker database, which includes 229 speakers with an average talking time exceeding 15 hours spanning across an average of 21 years per speaker. We assembled, cleaned, and normalized audio recordings and developed software tools for speech features extractions, all of which we are releasing to the public domain. © 2018 International Speech Communication Association.

It is demonstrated that themost accurate decisions are obtained using the geometricmean and mathematical expectation of the outputs at softmax layers of the convolutional neural networks for gender recognition and age prediction, respectively. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Age and gender recognition; Classifier fusion; Contextual advertising; Convolutional neural networks","Convolution; Neural networks; Age and gender recognition; Classifier fusion; Contextual advertisings; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Deep convolutional neural networks; Experimental comparison; Mathematical expectation; Deep neural networks",,,,,"Health and Safety Executive, HSE; National Research University Higher School of Economics, HES: 17-05-0007; Council on grants of the President of the Russian Federation","Acknowledgements The paper was prepared within the framework of the Academic Fund Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) in 2017 (grant 17-05-0007) and by the Russian Academic Excellence Project “5–100”.

However, little is known on whether modular structure of brain networks is reliable in terms of test-retest reproducibility and, most importantly, to what extent these topological modules are anatomically embedded. To address these questions,we use MRI data of the same individuals scanned with an interval of several weeks, reconstruct structural brain networks atmultiple scales, and partition them into communities and evaluate similarity of partitions (i) stemming from the test-retest data of the same versus different individuals and (ii) implied by network topology versus anatomybased grouping of neighboring regions. First, our results demonstrate that modular structure of brain networks is well reproducible in test-retest settings. Second, the results provide evidence of the theoretically well-motivated hypothesis that brain regions neighboring in anatomical space also tend to belong to the same topological modules. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Brain networks; Community structure; Modularity; Physically embedded networks; Test-retest reliability","Structure (composition); Topology; Brain networks; Community structures; Embedded network; Modularity; Test-retest reliability; Brain",,,,,"Health and Safety Executive, HSE; National Research University Higher School of Economics, HES: 16-05-0050","Acknowledgements The publication was prepared within the framework of the Academic Fund Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) in 2017 (grant 16-05-0050) and by the Russian Academic Excellence Project “5-100”.",,,,,,,,,,"Meunier, D., Renaud, L., Bullmore, E.T., Modular and hierarchically modular organization of brain networks (2010) Front.

The objective function minimizes the sum of travel costs, fixed vehicle costs, and penalties for soft time window violations. The algorithm is based on the tabu search with several neighborhoods. The main contribution of the paper is the efficient algorithm for a real-life vehicle routing problem. To the best of our knowledge, there are no papers devoted to the FSMVRP problem with soft time windows, while in real-life problems, this is a usual case. We investigate the performance of the proposed heuristic on the classical Solomon instances with additional constraints.

Elliptically contoured distributions became popular as probability model of stock market returns. The question of adequacy in this model to real market data is open. There are known results that reject such model and at the same time, there are results that approve such model. Obtained results are concerned to testing some properties of elliptical model. In the paper, another property of elliptical model namely property of symmetry condition of tails of two-dimensional distribution is considered. Multiple statistical procedure for testing elliptical model for stock returns distribution is proposed. Sign symmetry conditions of tails distribution are chosen as individual hypotheses for multiple testing. Uniformly, most powerful tests of Neyman structure are constructed for individual hypotheses testing. Associated step-wise multiple testing procedure is applied for the real market data. The main result is that under some conditions tail symmetry hypothesis is not rejected. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Elliptically contoured distributions; Family-wise error rate; Holm procedure; Multiple decision statistical procedure; Rejection graph; Stock market; Tail symmetry condition","Commerce; Financial markets; Investments; Statistical methods; Elliptically contoured distributions; Error rate; Holm procedure; Multiple decision statistical procedure; Rejection graph; Symmetry conditions; Probability distributions",,,,,"15-32-01052; National Research University Higher School of Economics, HSE","The work of Koldanov P.

We use co-authorship network to explore the structure of scientific collaboration. For network construction, the profiles of scientists from various countries and scientific fields in Google Scholar were used. We ran the count data regression model for a sample of more than 30 thousand authors with the first citation after 2007 to analyze the correlation between co-authorship network parameters of scientists and their citation characteristics. We identify that there is a positive correlation between citation of scientist and number of his co-authors, between citation and the author’s closeness centrality, and between scholar’s citation and the average citation of his co-authors. Also, we reveal that h-index and i10-index are correlated significantly with the number of co-authors and average citation of co-authors. Based on these results, we can conclude that scientists who maintain more contacts and more active than others have better bibliometric indicators on an average. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Bibliometric analysis; Co-authorship; Count data models; Google scholar; Social network analysis","Social networking (online); Bibliometric analysis; Bibliometric indicators; Closeness centralities; Co-authorship networks; Co-authorships; Count data models; Google scholar; Scientific collaboration; Regression analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbasi, A., Altmann, J., Hossain, L., Identifying the effects of co-authorship networks on the performance of scholars: A correlation and regression analysis of performance measures and social network analysis measures (2011) J.

Probability of sign coincidence of stock’s returns is used as the measure of similarity between stocks. Robust (distribution free) multiple testing statistical procedure for testing dynamics of network is proposed. The constructed procedure is applied for German, French, UK, and USA market.

First, the faces are detected in each frame and features of each facial region are extracted at the output of preliminarily trained deep convolution neural networks. Second, the tracks that contain identical faces are grouped using face verification algorithms and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. In the experimental study with the YTF dataset, we examined several ways to aggregate features of individual frame in order to obtain descriptor of the whole video track. It was demonstrated that the most accurate and fast algorithm is the matching of normalized average feature vectors. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Deep convolutional neural networks; Organizing video data; Video surveillance systems","Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Monitoring; Neural networks; Video recording; Convolution neural network; Deep convolutional neural networks; Face verification algorithms; Fast algorithms; Feature vectors; Hierarchical agglomerative clustering; Video data; Video surveillance systems; Security systems",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 14-41-00039; National Research University Higher School of Economics, HSE","The work was conducted at Laboratory of Algorithms and Technologies for Network Analysis, National Research University Higher School of Economics and supported by RSF (Russian Science Foundation) grant 14-41-00039.","Acknowledgements The work was conducted at Laboratory of Algorithms and Technologies for Network Analysis, National Research University Higher School of Economics and supported by RSF (Russian Science Foundation) grant 14-41-00039.",,,,,,,,,"Zhang, Y.J., Lu, H.B., A hierarchical organization scheme for video data (2002) Pattern Recogn, 35 (11), pp. 2381-2387; Sokolova, A.D., Kharchevnikova, A.S., Savchenko, A.V., (2017) Organizingmulti-Media Data in Video Surveillance Systems Based on Face Verification with Convolutional Neural Networks; Chen, J.C., Ranjan, R., Kumar, A., Chen, C.H., Patel, V.M., Chellappa, R., An end-to-end system for unconstrained face verification with deep convolutional neural networks (2015) IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, pp. 118-126; Li, H., Hua, G., Shen, X., Lin, Z., Brandt, J., Eigen-PEP for video face recognition (2014) Asian Conference on Computer Vision.

In this case, the search of the closest object can be thought as a search of a node in a network. A procedure in a network is called decentralized, if it uses only local information about visited nodes and its neighbors. Networks, which structure allows efficient performing the nearest neighbor search by a decentralized search procedure started from any node, is of particular interest, especially for pure distributed systems. Several algorithms that construct such networks have been proposed in literature. However, the following questions arise: “Are there network models in which decentralized search can be performed faster?”; “What are the optimal networks for the decentralized search?”; “What are their properties?” In this paper, we partially give answers to these questions. We propose a mathematical programming model for the problem of determining an optimal network structure for decentralized nearest neighbor search. We have found an exact solution for a regular lattice of size 4×4 and heuristic solutions for sizes from 5×5 to 7×7. As a distance function, we use L1, L2 and L∞ metrics. We hope that our results and the proposed model will initiate study of optimal network structures for decentralized nearest neighbor search. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Nearest neighbour search; Network decentralised search; Optimisation model","Mathematical programming; Structural optimization; Decentralised; Decentralized searches; Distributed systems; Heuristic solutions; Mathematical programming models; Nearest neighbour search; Optimal network structure; Optimisation models; Nearest neighbor search",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 14-41-00039; National Research University Higher School of Economics, HSE","Acknowledgements This research is conducted in LATNA Laboratory, National Research University Higher School of Economics and supported by RSF grant 14-41-00039.",,,,,,,,,,"Kleinberg, J., The small-world phenomenon: An algorithmic perspective (2000) Proceedings of the Thirty-Second Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 163-170. , ACM, May; Beaumont, O., Kermarrec, A.-M., Marchal, L., Riviere, E., VoroNet: A scalable object network based on Voronoi tessellations (2007) Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, 2007, pp. 1-10. , IPDPS 2007.

We examine the case of the “Korean Wave” from two perspectives. The first perspective is a panel data showing the direct influence of the Korean Wave on the volume of incoming tourists and the development of the conjugated sectors of the economy (including trade and industry) based on statistics, reports, and survey results published by various Korean government agencies and institutions. The second perspective is the range of governmental measures and initiatives implemented to boost and promote the effect of the Korean Wave. The scientific dialectical method of cognition was used in the survey to study the role and influence of the Hallyu phenomenon on the change in economic indicators of cultural tourism, as well as the calculation and analytical methods such as monitoring, measurement, analysis, and comparison of statistical and economic indicators. The results of this study give some insights into how Hallyu influenced the growth of the number of tourists, the amount of goods related to the Korean Wave export, and governmental legislative measures that led to the promotion and dispersion of the Korean Wave. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Economic analysis; Surveys; Analytical method; Economic impacts; Economic indicators; Korean Government; Legislative measures; Panel data; South Korea; Industrial economics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://avia-baikalvisa.ru/South-Korea/K-POP_tur_v_Seul, (accessed 24.11.2017); https://www.onedaykorea.com/tour-packages/hallyu-2/hallyu/, (accessed 13.11.2017); http://www.seoulcitytour.net/English, (accessed 13.11.2017); Buraev, D.I., Garmahanov, M.T., Korean Wave and Soft Power (2014) Bulletin of the Buryat State University, (8), pp. 115-119; Cai, J., The First Taste of Korean Wave in China, , http://journeyeast.tripod.com/korean_wave_in_china.html, (accessed: 24.11.2017); Chang, P., Lee, H., (2017) The Korean Wave: Determinants and Its Impacts on Trade and FDI; Garmahanov, M.T., Political and economical influence of “Korean wave” in the beginning of XXI century (2013) Bulletin of the Buryat State University, (8), pp. 78-80; Garmahanov, M.T., (2015) Korean Wave, 8, pp. 123-126. , China.

Consumers are looking for authentic experiences such as local gastronomic traditions. The research analyses the current situation of inbound tourism in Russia, particularly of Russian gastronomic tourism. For this purpose, the dialectical approach to the analysis of the results of an opinion poll held among the students of Moscow universities studying Tourism and Travel Management is applied. The paper identifies the causes of problems divided into four groups. This analysis contributes to the solution of the problems and promotion of an active development of the inbound gastronomic tourism in Russia. The obtained results underline the correlation between gastronomic inbound tourism and the professional development of Gastronomy Travel Managers. It is concluded that gastronomic tourism management should be incorporated as a subject of study in Tourism and Travel Management programs. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Current situation; Inbound tourisms; Management IS; Management programs; Professional development; Research analysis; Tourism industry; Tourism management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Angelina, I.A., (2016) The Main Definitions of the Development of Gastronomic Tourism.

At present, almost all travel companies that desire to stay profitable and be customeroriented use the Big Data technology. Therefore, we have several questions to answer: should we use Big Data in tourism or should we not? How to use it? What kind of risks we should consider in order to achieve effective results? These research problems were examined through a thorough analysis of Russian and world travel markets using statistical data on several sites, programs, and organizations that are associated with the tourism industry (e.g., Booking.com, Trivago). The main result of this study is to substantiate the importance of Big Data technology for the travel industry. Big Data technology helps to personally connect companies and clients of the sector so that their interaction would lead to their mutual benefits.

The dome height during each test was continuously measured and recorded using a magnetostrictive position transducer. All the tests were performed using stepped pressure regime with jump pressure changing between two values at evenly spaced time moments. This experimental technique provides the possibility to study strain rate sensitivity index variation during the test and subsequently construct strain and strain rate dependent material model. The output data of each test include the evolution of dome height, subsequent pressure regime and final thickness of the specimen at the dome pole. In the framework of this study the processing of such data in order to evaluate the material behavior is discussed. Inverse analysis with different material models was implemented as well as special direct technique allowing one to construct stress-strain curves based on the results of free bulging tests with pressure jumps. The obtained material model was verified by finite element simulation. © 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland","Biaxial tension; Free bulging test; Stress-strain behavior; Superplastic forming; Testing; Ti6Al4V; Titanium alloy","Aluminum alloys; Data handling; Domes; Sensitivity analysis; Stress-strain curves; Superplasticity; Ternary alloys; Testing; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Biaxial tensions; Free bulging; Stress-strain behaviors; Superplastic forming; Ti-6al-4v; Strain rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albakri, M., Abu-Farha, F., Khraisheh, M., A new combined experimental-numerical approach to evaluate formability of rate dependent materials (2013) International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 66, pp. 55-66; Aksenov, S.A., Kolesnikov, A.V., Mikhaylovskaya, A.V., Design of a gas forming technology using the material constants obtained by tensile and free bulging testing (2016) Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 237, pp. 88-95; Jarrar, F., Jafar, R., Tulupova, O., Enikeev, F., Al-Huniti, N., Constitutive modeling for the simulation of the superplastic forming of AA5083 (2016) Materials Science Forum, 838-839, pp. 512-517; Taleff, E.M., Jr., Hector, L.G., Verma, R., Krajewski, P.E., Chang, J.K., Material models for simulation of superplastic Mg alloy sheet forming (2010) Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance, 19 (4), pp. 488-494; El-Morsy, A., Akkus, N., Manabe, K., Nishimura, H., Superplastic characteristics of Ti-alloy and Al-alloy sheets by multi-dome forming test (2001) Mater.

Building a lexicon of discourse connectives is an indispensable subtask in many discourse parsing applications as well as an essential issue in theoretical researches of text coherence. In order to develop such a resource for Russian, we have conducted a corpus-based study of discourse connectives that were manually extracted from the Russian Rhetorical Structure Treebank (Ru-RSTreebank). The Treebank includes 79 texts annotated within the RST framework (Mann, Thompson 1988). In order to provide a deeper analysis of connectives in Russian, we focus on causal relations only, namely, the 'Cause-Effect' relation. Some of the connectives (primary connectives) are enumerated in grammars and dictionaries. They primarily mark the intra-sentential relations. However, there is an expansive class of less grammaticalized items (secondary connectives) that have received less attention till now. Some of them are based on content words (e.g. по причине 'for the cause'). Secondary connectives often serve as linking devices for inter-sentential relations. We suggest a scheme for connectives annotation for Russian. We specify the basic patterns that can be used for less-grammaticalized connectives mining in an unannotated corpus. Besides, we provide the comparison of two classes of connectives (primary vs. secondary ones). Our research has shown that these two classes differ in their properties. There is a statistically significant difference between them with respect to the nucleus/ satellite position, intra- vs. inter-sentential relations and some others. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

This became a limitation, especially for languages with complex morphology: their vocabularies are quite large, and most words are infrequent which results in models being unable to learn good semantic representations for such words. In this paper, we compare two approaches aimed at including subword information for Russian using distributional word embedding models trained on the Russian National Corpus. We evaluate these approaches on the newly created rare and multimorphemic word similarity dataset, which itself is another contribution of ours. Overall, we show the benefits of using subword informations for learning better semantic representations of words. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

Subject indexes usually contain particular single-word and multi-word terms from the corresponding documents. Such indexes are especially useful for reading large documents with specialized terminology, as well as educational texts in difficult scientific and technical areas. The central problem of back-of-the-book indexing is recognition of terms to be included into the index. The paper describes a method developed for extracting and filtering terms from a given educational scientific text, with the purpose of reliable term selection in computer indexing systems. The method is primarily based on rules with lexico-syntactic patterns representing linguistic information about terms and typical contexts of their usage in Russian scientific and educational texts; simple occurrences statistics of terms is used as well. Experimental evaluation of the method has shown a considerable increase of precision and recall of term extraction compared with the widely-used standard techniques. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

A research in this framework is based on the analysis of distributional properties of the lexemes in question. Hence, questionnaires for such studies consist of typical contexts where lexical items from a given semantic domain can potentially occur. We aim at filling these questionnaires automatically, and this task can be splitted into two different problems: questionnaire translation and its filling with the relevant data. We suggest three methods for the first task completion (translation via bilingual dictionaries vs. online cloud translators vs. parallel corpora), and two algorithms are focused on the second task (filling of a questionnaire based on monolingual corpora vs. on online translators). We test our algorithm on the data from four semantic domains of qualitative features ('sharp', 'smooth', 'thick', 'thin'). © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

However, will the fact that these nouns are less frequent than masculine nouns ending in a consonant or feminine nouns ending in -a/ja play a role for online subject-predicate agreement processing? Or will subject-predicate agreement processing be more problematic with subjects of a certain gender? Finally, some final consonants are more characteristic for feminine gender, while the others for masculine gender. Are speakers sensitive to this? We present two experiments addressing these questions. We found that all three factors play a role, but for different tasks (online agreement processing or determining the gender of a novel word) and at different processing stages. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

Consider sentences like Chainik dolgo zakipal 'It took the kettle a long time to boil, lit. Kettle for a long time boiled' vs. Chainik dolgo ne zakipal 'It took the kettle a long time to boil, lit. Kettle for a long time not boiled'. The paper is an attempt to define the semantic and pragmatic mechanisms of such quasi-synonymy, as well as semantic and aspectual classes of predicates where it occurs. It also considers subtle semantic, pragmatic and communicative differences associated with non-negated and negated construction, respectively. Such quasi-synonymy occurs primarily in cases when the predicate belongs to the aspectual class of accomplishments and denotes a telic process or action with a desired result ('to boil', 'to cool down', 'to warm up', 'to grow up', 'to finish', etc.). Those predicates include two major semantic components, that is, a lasting process or action and an instant result. In the imperfective aspect they allow at least two possible interpretations, namely, of a process and that of a result. Similar interpretations of sentences with such predicates occur due to different scope assignments of negation and dolgo. In sentences with non-negated predicate dolgo has scope over the 'process' component in the verb; in sentences with negated predicate negation has scope over the 'result' component of the verb while at the same time falling into the scope of dolgo. The former type of sentences describes long-lasting processes, whereas the latter type describes long-awaited results, which pragmatically amount to the same thing. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

To investigate whether this difference might be due to an over-representation of a speaker who happens to be an outlier in terms of using a particular morpheme, we use DP, a measurement of evenness of the distribution of a specific linguistic feature across subcorpora of the same corpus. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

Corpus is constructed in the way its segments provide the most up to date NLP problems with big data. The goal of the project is to provide a growing Russian NLP community with large and accurately collected corpus materials, as well as to reflect the shift in the global paradigm of corpora studies, by which only open source data makes it possible to investigate the distribution of interesting linguistic phenomena independently and completely, refusing the “black box” interface usage. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

The resulting corpus consists of about 500 academic papers. We focus on the analysis of developing research trends manifested in topical drift over time.

The factors at play in scope disambiguation are the syntactic function of the constituent containing all (subject, direct complement, adjunct); the status of the main predicate and all with respect to the information structure of the utterance (topic vs. focus); veridical vs. non-veridical context; sentence type (unreal conditional, rhetorical question); and pragmatic implicatures pertaining to the situations described in the utterances.

We also claim that different speakers possess different sets of meanings for each word, propose ways to discover the distribution patterns for these sets and introduce the notion of disperse polysemy. We believe that our findings may be useful in lexicography (providing detailed information on current word usage in different social groups), lexical semantics (researching meaning shifts and patterns of its distribution among speakers), and language testing (more precise detection of the vocabulary sizes both in native speakers and in language learners). © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

The aim of the research was to find out what types of speech acts commonly initiate and complete everyday dialogues, as well as to reveal the most typical sequences of speech acts in these dialogues. Altogether, 2230 speech acts of 30 people referring to both professional, and household conversations have been analysed. N-gram analysis has been used to calculate the most frequent sequences of speech acts. The obtained results showed that dialogues are usually started by representatives, i. e. speech acts related to the exchange of information (38% of all cases), etiquette beginnings (greetings, vocatives) take place in 23% of the dialogues, and in 19% of cases the conversation begins with a regulative form. Speech acts ending dialogues show a greater variety: representatives contribute 2% of all dialogue ends, valuative judgments and regulatory forms cover 14% each, further go directives (8%), commissions (8%), etiquette forms (8%) and emotional and expressive form (7%). As for the most typical bigrams of speech acts, they are the following: two consecutive representatives (22.35%), a regulatory form followed by a representative (6.93%), a representative and a regulatory form (6%), a valuative with a following representative (5.21%), a representative and a valuative judgment (4.77%), as well as two combinations of a directive with a representative (2.77% each). Besides, the article presents data on the occurrence of the most frequent pairs of speech acts at the subtype level. Here, the most frequent one is the sequence question+answer, which covers 2.45%. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet Society of Cosmetic Chemists.

In this paper, we show that PISA scores of individual students can be predicted from their digital traces. We use data from the nationwide Russian panel study that tracks 4,400 participants of PISA and includes information about their activity on a popular social networking site. We build a simple model that predicts PISA scores based on students' subscriptions to various public pages on the social network. The resulting model can successfully discriminate between low- and high-performing students (AUC = 0.9). We find that top-performing students are interested in pages related to science and art, while pages preferred by low-performing students typically concern humor and horoscopes. The difference in academic performance between subscribers to such public pages could be equivalent to several years of formal schooling, indicating the presence of a strong digital divide. The ability to predict academic outcomes of students from their digital traces might unlock the potential of social media data for large-scale education research.

For that, algorithms rely on smart techniques for enumerating the pattern search space and, generally, focus on compressed collections of patterns (e.g. closed patterns), to avoid redundancy. Formal Concept Analysis offers a generic framework, called pattern structures, to formalize many types of patterns, such as closed itemsets, intervals, graph and sequence sets. Additionally, it provides generic algorithms to enumerate all closed patterns and only them. The only condition is that the pattern space is a meet-semilattice, which, unfortunately does not always hold (e.g., for sequential and graph patterns). In this paper, we discuss pattern setups, a tool that models pattern search spaces relying only on posets. Subsequently, we revisit some techniques transforming pattern setups to a pattern structure using set of patterns, namely completions, and we state a necessary and sufficient condition for a pattern setup completion using antichains to be a pattern structure. © paper author(s), 2018.",,"Computer programming; Information analysis; Set theory; Textile printing; Closed itemsets; Closed pattern; Generic algorithm; Generic frameworks; Graph patterns; Pattern mining; Pattern search; Pattern structure; Formal concept analysis",,,,,"Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie, ANRT; Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 17-11-01276","This work has been partially supported the Association Nationale Recherche Technologie (ANRT) French program.

Several studies have been conducted for mass production assembly lines where short cycle times make the work content highly repetitive. However, the case of low-volume production with long cycle times and different impacts on human operators has been rarely considered in the literature. In this paper, we develop a model to take into account the associated ergonomic risks in assembly lines with long cycle times. An optimization method is also developed in order to schedule tasks and assign the required tasks to a set of human operators taking into account the existing ergonomic risks. © 2018 The Authors.

To strengthen the porous soil, a low concentration cement-based grout is pumped into it under pressure. The suspension is filtered in a porous medium and fills the cavity of the soil. Grains of the grout are distributed along the network structure of the porous medium and strengthen the soil. The transfer of particles by a flow of a carrier fluid is accompanied by an uneven formation of a deposit on the porous medium frame. The purpose of the paper is to determine the mobile two-phase boundary between water and the particles during the injection of a suspension into a porous medium and to obtain an analytical solution of the nonlinear filtration problem for a general case of variable porosity and permeability. The mathematical model of one-dimensional deep bed filtration with size-exclusion particles retention includes the equations of mass balance and kinetic rate of a deposit and unsteady boundary conditions with unknown dimensionless concentrations of suspended and retained particles. Methods of non-linear asymptotic analysis are used to obtain the analytical solution and to construct an asymptotics near the porous medium inlet. The asymptotics is determined on the basis of a local exact solution of the problem. It is shown that the mobile two-phase boundary moves with variable speed. At the boundary of two phases, the concentration of suspended particles is discontinuous, and the concentration of retained particles is continuous and loses its smoothness. The exact explicit formula for the two-phase boundary and its asymptotics in a form convenient for calculations are obtained. An exact solution is obtained on the boundary of the porous medium and the asymptotics of the filtration problem is constructed near the porous medium inlet. Numerical calculation of the asymptotic solution is performed; graphs of the dependence of concentrations on time and coordinate are presented. In contrast to the numerical solution, analytical methods make it possible to determine the dependence of the solution of the filtration problem on the controlled external parameters. This allows the construction engineers to choose the best size of injected grout grains and the properties of the carrier fluid, optimize the filtration process and form a grouted porous soil of the required strength and density. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Asymptotic analysis; Deposits; Grouting; Mechanical permeability; Mortar; Numerical methods; Phase boundaries; Soil cement; Soils; Suspensions (fluids); Water filtration; Water injection; Asymptotic solutions; Cement based grouts; Construction engineers; Deep bed filtration; Filtration problems; Nonlinear filtration; Numerical calculation; Suspended particles; Porous materials",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Li, S., Liu, R., Zhang, Q., Zhang, X., Protection against water or mud inrush in tunnels by grouting: A review (2016) J. of Rock Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, 8 (5), pp. 753-766; Bradford, S.A., Torkzaban, S., Shapiro, A.A., A theoretical analysis of colloid attachment and straining in chemically heterogeneous porous media (2013) Langmuir, 29 (23), pp. 6944-6952; Polyakov, Y.S., Zydney, A.L., Ultrafiltration membrane performance: Effects of pore blockage/constriction (2013) J. of Membrane Science, 434, pp. 106-120; Santos, A., Bedrikovetsky, P., Fontoura, S., Analytical micro model for size exclusion: Pore blocking and permeability reduction (2008) J. of Membrane Science, 308 (1-2), pp. 115-127; Bashtani, F., Ayatollahi, S., Habibi, A., Masihi, M., Permeability reduction of membranes during particulate suspension flow; Analytical micro model of size exclusion mechanism (2013) J. of Membrane Science, 435, pp. 155-164; Herzig, J.P., Leclerc, D.M., Legoff, P., Flow of suspensions through porous media - Application to deep filtration (1970) Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 62 (5), pp. 8-35; Vyazmina, E.A., Bedrikovetskii, P.G., Polyanin, A.D., New classes of exact solutions to nonlinear sets of equations in the theory of filtration and convective mass transfer (2007) Theoretical Foundations of Chemical Engineering, 41 (5), pp. 556-564; You, Z., Osipov, Y., Bedrikovetsky, P., Kuzmina, L., Asymptotic model for deep bed filtration (2014) Chemical Engineering J., 258, pp. 374-385; Kuzmina, L.I., Osipov Yu, V., Asymptotic solution for deep bed filtration with small deposit (2015) Procedia Engineering, 111, pp. 491-494; Galaguz, Y.P., Safina, G.L., Modeling of fine migration in a porous medium (2016) (MATEC Web of Conferences, 86; You, Z., Bedrikovetsky, P., Kuzmina, L., Exact solution for long-term size exclusion suspension-colloidal transport in porous media (2013) Abstract and Applied Analysis, 2013, p. 1. , article ID 680693; Kuzmina, L.I., Osipov Yu, V., Particle transportationat the filter inlet (2014) Int.

Some of them are combinations with the sling shot effect used in several interplanetary missions. In one type of this family of applications, the tether is attached to an asteroid to make a rotation of the spacecraft, so giving energy to send it to the exterior planets of the Solar System or beyond. A similar idea is to make the capture of spacecrafts by a planet of the Solar System using tethers fixed on their moons. In both of these proposals, the tether is carried on-board the spacecraft and anchored to the celestial body during the approach phase. Another possibility is to build an ""Escape Portal"" using a tether permanently fixed in an asteroid to give energy to spacecrafts to go to the outer planets. The present paper explores in more detail a combination of those two proposals to build a ""Capture Portal"" for the planets. The main idea is to build a permanent structure fixed on one of the moons of a given planet, so that it can be used for an unlimited number of maneuvers. With this goal, this research searches for equilibrium points that can be used to place the above structures. The type of force in the tether and the stability of the points are also considered. The results shown here can give some insights in the problems that appear when building such “Capture Portal”. © 2018 Univelt Inc.

To make this task, a tether is attached to the surface of one of the asteroids, with a spacecraft attached in the other end. The analysis of the equilibrium points to place the tether and the stability of those solutions are made. The irregularities of the bodies, assumed to be ellipsoids, are described by the coefficients of a spherical harmonic expansion. The coefficients of this expansion are functions of the dimensions of the bodies. The equilibrium conditions are studied by searching for the situations where the forces acting in the spacecraft have a zero resultant, assuming that only the gravity of both irregular bodies are present in the system.

This contribution takes the latter perspective, analyzing social trust and trust in institutions as integral parts of social cohesion more generally. Despite ongoing worries about the state of social cohesion in contemporary societies, surprisingly little is known as to which macrolevel conditions actually weaken social cohesion, and which foster it. It remains an open question whether social cohesion is shaped by universal social forces that work similarly in various world regions, or by region-specific ones (the same holds true for outcomes of social cohesion). Against this background, the present paper seeks to advance our understanding of correlates of social cohesion by systematically comparing Western and Asian societies. The empirical analysis is based on the most comprehensive index of social cohesion currently available, the Bertelsmann Social Cohesion Radar. In separate analyses of 34 Western and 22 Asian societies, the authors explore the associations of economic, social, political, and cultural conditions with cohesion, as well as the associations between cohesion and population well-being. The results suggest that while some correlates (such as economic prosperity) can indeed be considered universal, others (e.g. Income inequality, political freedom) work differently in Western and Asian societies. The authors link these findings to sociological and cross-cultural psychological theories on Asian modernization and Asian values. The practical conclusion is that not all policy recommendations for strengthening social cohesion can easily travel from one world region to another. © Jan Delhey, Klaus Boehnke, Georgi Dragolov, Zsofia S.

Being developed for more than 60 years the problem has been considered in many different formulations. In real-life goods distribution such constraints as fleet size and mix, site-dependency constraints, hard and soft time windows, vehicle capacity constraints are very important. In this paper we consider Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with hard Time Windows. We propose a hybrid heuristic algorithm which contains elements of ant colony optimization strategy and tabu search technique. Our algorithm shows good performance and results for the well-known Solomon dataset.

Equations of motion are obtained, conditions for the tether to be stretched are investigated. The constraint releasing processes, as well as constrained activations, are also considered. The computer model for dynamics of the tethered space system (TSS) is built considering the mechanical system subject to an unilateral constraint. The model is constructed as a hybrid automata. The corresponding state variables are described as Real type, that provides a possibility to efficiently developed numerical model for transfers from constrained state of mechanical system to its unconstrained state and back. © 2018","Asteroid exploration; Generalised two-body problem; Hybrid automata; Newtonian impact model; Space elevator; State variables; Tethered systems","Asteroids; Automata theory; Equations of motion; Mechanics; Robots; Tetherlines; Asteroid exploration; Hybrid automatons; Impact model; Space elevators; State variables; Tethered systems; Two-body problem; Pendulums",,,,,"POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007718; Chao Center for Asian Studies, Rice University, CCAS: Centro-01-0145-FEDER-000017; Universidade da Beira Interior, UBI; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, RFBR: 16-01-00625a; Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 14-21-00068","This research is partially supported by RFBR (grant 16-01-00625a) at CCAS, project EMaDeS (Centro-01-0145-FEDER-000017), the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technologies via Centre for Mechanical and Aerospace Science and Technologies, C-MAST (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007718) at UBI, and for the third author by RSF project No. 14-21-00068 (Section 4 and computer simulations) at MAI.",,,,,,,,,,"Artsutanov, Y.A., (1960), To space on… electric locomotive.

In this paper we study the problem of finding the point spread function (PSF) of a blurred image using the tomography technique. The PSF reconstruction result strongly depends on the particular tomography technique used. We present a tomography algorithm with regularization adapted specifically for this task. We use the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART algorithm) as the starting algorithm and introduce regularization. We use the conjugate gradient method for numerical implementation of the proposed approach. The algorithm is tested using a dataset which contains 9 kernels extracted from real photographs by the Adobe corporation where the point spread function is known. We also investigate influence of noise on the quality of image reconstruction and investigate how the number of projections influence the magnitude change of the reconstruction error. © 2018 Copyright SPIE.","algebraic reconstruction techniques; Motion blur; point spread function; regularization","Algebra; Computer vision; Conjugate gradient method; Numerical methods; Optical transfer function; Photography; Tomography; Algebraic reconstruction techniques; Blur kernel estimations; Motion blur; Numerical implementation; Reconstruction error; regularization; Starting algorithms; Tomography algorithm; Image reconstruction",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 14-50-00150","The algorithm RegART was proposed and investigation of its properties was done with support from the Russian Science Foundation grant (project No. 14-50-00150).",,,,,,,,,,"Chereau, R., Breckon, Robust, T.P., Motion filtering as an enabler to video stabilization for a teleoperated mobile robot (2013) Proc.

Generically, a pseudo-Riemannian metric on a 2-manifold S changes its signature (degenerates) along a curve S0, which locally separates S into a Riemannian (R) and a Lorentzian (L) domain. The geodesic flow does not have singularities over R and L, and for any point q∈ R∪ L and every tangential direction p∈ ℝℙ there exists a unique geodesic passing through the point q with the direction p. On the contrary, geodesics cannot pass through a point q∈ S0 in arbitrary tangential directions, but only in some admissible directions; the number of admissible directions is 1 or 2 or 3. We study this phenomenon and the local properties of geodesics near q∈ S0. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Geodesics; Normal forms; Pseudo-Riemannian metrics; Singular points","Geodesy; Surveys; Admissible directions; Geodesic flow; Geodesics; Local property; Normal form; Riemannian metrics; Singular points; Tangential directions; Geometry",,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ: 16-01-00766, 17-01-00849","Fig. 14 The invariant foliation p2 = y − αy2 in the (x, y, p)-space (left) and the corresponding geodesics (right).

In this context, our paper aims to explore and profile the nature and dynamics of the Quadruple/Quintuple Helix Innovation System Model or Framework (government, university, industry, civil society, environment) as an enabler and enactor of regional co-opetitive entrepreneurial ecosystems which we conceptualize as fractal, multi-level, multi-modal, multi-nodal, and multi-lateral configurations of dynamic tangible and intangible assets within the resource-based view and the new theory of the growth of the firm. Co-opetitive fractal innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems are defined and discussed, and examples of regional innovation policies and programs are presented. Furthermore, the concept of multi-level innovation systems is analyzed, taking into account the existence of knowledge clusters and innovation networks, while alternative aggregations of multi-level innovation systems are proposed based on their spatial (geographical) and non-spatial (research-based) functional properties. © 2017 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,,,,"Health and Safety Executive, HSE; National Research University Higher School of Economics, HES; Government Council on Grants, Russian Federation","The article was partially prepared within the frame-work of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and partially supported within the framework of the subsidy granted to the HSE by the Government of the Russian Federation for the implementation of the Global Competitiveness Program.",,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Alcotra Innovation Experience Handbook how to set up cross-border Living Labs., , http://www.alcotra-innovation.eu/livingLabs/dwd/Alcotra_Innovazione_Handbook_2013.pdf; Arnkil, R., Järvensivu, A., Koski, P., Piirainen, T., (2010) Exploring Quadruple Helix outlining user-oriented innovation models, , https://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/65758/978-951-44-8209-0.pdf?sequence=1, Final Report on Quadruple Helix Research for the CLIQ project, Working Paper 85/2010.
